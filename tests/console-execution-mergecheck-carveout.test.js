// carve-out #1179 already pinned in tests/console-autoresolve-needs-human-carveout.test.js for

// spec did not scope (console-execution.md runs later, in a foreign session with no access to
// the original session's merge-check verdict, so it needs its OWN persisted copy to read).

// documented convention this project wants enforced"). Go-red proof [IL-105]: each pattern is
// also run against a frozen pre-change excerpt that carries the anchor but lacks the carve-out,
// so a green result proves the pattern can fail for the attributable reason. Whitespace is
// collapsed on both haystack and needle [IL-66].
