// #296's second Task() call must resume the FIRST call's run directory rather than
// starting a disconnected fresh one — otherwise build/test's decisions.md and staged
// proposals are orphaned from the eventual Review Console. This was reviewed as fixed
// twice and found inert both times: the sending half (dispatch derives {run-dir} and
// substitutes it into the second call's literal command line) and the receiving half
// (/flow Step 3 actually adopts a pre-set PIPELINE_RUN_DIR instead of always creating a
// fresh one) were each individually plausible but never verified as connected. This test
// pins both halves of that chain directly in the operative prose, so a future edit to
// either side that breaks the link fails the suite instead of shipping silently a third
// time.
