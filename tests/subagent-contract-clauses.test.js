// Two records landed in one change, in the same two files and largely the same
// paragraphs: #124 supplied the *why* (the Subagent Contract is dispatch-correctness
// discipline, not the "token-saving infrastructure" it was once labelled) and #153
// the *who* (third-party agents are exempt, on a structural condition).
//
// They are mutually load-bearing, which is why the check guards both rather than
// either alone. The exemption argues *from* the correctness framing — "the contract
// buys dispatch correctness for agents we author, so a delegation adapts at the
// boundary instead" — and reads as arbitrary the moment the surrounding prose calls
// the contract a cost optimization again. In the other direction, the correctness
// framing loses its one worked example if the exemption goes.
//
// #153's acceptance criterion 8 asks for a durable artifact rather than a one-time
// instruction, on the grounds that "read #124 before editing" protects only the
// person who reads it. This is that artifact: an unrelated future edit that drops
// either clause fails the suite instead of silently leaving the file arguing against
// itself.
