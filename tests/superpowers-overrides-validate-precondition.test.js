// must state a Validate/visual-review precondition before ANY merge decision —
// /superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch's prompt AND the pr-first
// gh pr merge path (_shared/pr-first-merge.md) — for UI-dependent work, must
// treat a silently self-skipped check as not satisfying the precondition, must
// exempt backend/infra work with no UI surface, and must exempt a non-web
// frontend surface with no automated rendered-check channel via an explicit
// decline. The Superpowers overrides line is a live, incrementally-growing
// convention statement (not content a future migration will delete), so this
// follows the same declared-contract read-live pattern as
// tests/specify-auto-continue-conformance.test.js rather than freezing a fixture.
