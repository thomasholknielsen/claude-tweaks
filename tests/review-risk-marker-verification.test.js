// tests/review-risk-marker-verification.test.js — #362: pins the Risk-Marker Verification
// sub-check added to /claude-tweaks:review Step 1 (Spec Compliance Check) — a spec's own
// self-flagged risk (a Gotchas bullet not marked "validated", a red-team inline
// `<!-- ambiguity: -->` marker, or an `## Open Questions` row) must be independently verified
// against the artifact's real external validator/schema/tool, not merely read as informational
// prose, and an unresolved one after that check routes the Gate to BLOCKED — the same tier as
// "Significant gaps". Also pins spec-template.md's cross-reference from the spec-authoring side.
//
// Frozen pre-change excerpts (the text `code-mode-steps.md` and `spec-template.md` carried
// immediately before #362's commits 61ea1f3f6 / fdeb5fd0d) prove each pattern can go red
// [IL-105] — a Step 1 / Empirical Premise-Check rewrite that drops the binding language fails
// this suite instead of silently shipping a mention-only version of the rule.

Skip this step entirely under \`ceremony-profile: fast-lane\` (see "Ceremony-Aware Step Selection"
above) — proceed directly to Step 1.5.

If a spec number was provided, read the spec file and verify the implementation meets it:

> **Parallel execution:** Use parallel tool calls aggressively — all Grep/Glob/Read operations searching the codebase for each deliverable's implementation and each criterion's verifiability are independent and should run concurrently.

1. **Deliverables** — for each deliverable checkbox in the spec, search the codebase for the implementation. Mark each as \`done\`, \`partial\`, or \`missing\`.
2. **Acceptance Criteria** — for each criterion, determine whether it's verifiable from the code and tests. Mark as \`met\`, \`partially met\`, or \`not met\`.
3. **Non-Goals** — verify the implementation didn't accidentally include work scoped out by the spec's Non-Goals section.

### Gate:

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| All deliverables done + all criteria met | Proceed to Step 1.5 |
| Minor gaps (1-2 partial items) | Flag gaps, proceed — they may be addressed in Implementation Hindsight |
| Significant gaps (missing deliverables or criteria) | **BLOCKED** — the spec isn't fully built yet. List what's missing so the user can resume \`/claude-tweaks:build\` |

If blocked, skip the rest of the review. Present the gap analysis so the user knows exactly what to finish.`;

const PRE_CHANGE_SPEC_TEMPLATE = `## Empirical Premise-Check Deliverables

When a spec's technical approach rests on an assumption about how an external system, harness, or tool actually behaves — an undocumented payload shape, an unconfirmed API contract, an assumed invocation path — write a blocking first deliverable ("Task 0") that captures the real behavior before any other deliverable's fixtures are written. Word its scope as an enumeration, not a single check, and cover every path that reaches the feature, not just every shape the resulting payload can take:

- **Who initiates it** — a person typing the trigger directly (a slash command, a manual action), the model invoking it as part of its own reasoning, a Task-dispatched subagent invoking it on the model's behalf, and a headless/non-interactive run (\`claude -p\`, a scheduled Routine) invoking it with no one watching. These are different code paths through the harness and can diverge in whether an event fires at all, not just in what it contains.
- **Every shape the payload can take once it does fire** — qualified vs. bare identifiers, success vs. failure, nested vs. top-level invocation.

Enumerating only the second list and skipping the first is the failure mode to design against: it reads as thorough (every input shape is covered) while silently leaving out an entire initiation path that never produces an event to shape-check in the first place — a gap no fixture built from the captured shapes can catch, because the missing case never got captured. Name each initiator path explicitly in the Task 0 deliverable's own text; do not let "covers all invocation shapes" stand in for it.`;
