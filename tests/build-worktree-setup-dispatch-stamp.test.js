// #778: a dispatched /flow run's first commit was denied by the working-directory
// hook (E1) because build/worktree-setup.md's "already in a linked worktree" skip
// guard skipped its ENTIRE procedure — including Step 4.5's record-worktree stamp
// — whenever GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON. That detection was framed as multi-spec-only,
// but dispatch/sequential-execution.md creates and enters a group's worktree
// directly (singleton or bundle) via EnterWorktree, which never itself calls
// record-worktree. /flow's own multi-spec up-front creation happens to run this
// file's full procedure (so it stamps fine), but a dispatch-created worktree
// arrives at Common Step 1 with no stamp at all, and the skip guard used to skip
// the one step that would have fixed it. This test pins the fix: Step 4.5 must
// still run — unconditionally, since it's documented as an idempotent restamp —
// even on the skip-creation path, and the guard must be worded to say so.
