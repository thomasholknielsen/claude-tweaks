// Observed live 2026-08-13: a dispatch-created worktree's /flow invocation created its run
// directory (config.yml/decisions.md/staged/, plus every spec-{N}/ subdirectory) *inside*
// that worktree instead of the main checkout, contradicting _shared/pipeline-run-dir.md's own
// Anchoring section — whose entire purpose is that a worktree removal can never destroy
// pipeline state. Root cause: the actual creation-time path templates in flow/manifesto.md,
// flow/multi-spec.md, and flow/steps-and-gates.md gave a bare relative path with no
// instruction to resolve $RUN_ROOT first, even though materialize.md's /build standalone
// fallback and _shared/pipeline-run-dir.md's own bash snippet already did this correctly.
// These guards pin that every run-dir creation site now states the anchoring requirement
// explicitly, so a future edit can't silently drop it again.
