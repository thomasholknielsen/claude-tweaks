// CLAUDE.md is inherited by every dispatched subagent (72-144 per /dispatch run),
// so bytes here are the most expensive bytes in the repo. #233/#234 landed the file
// at ~51.8 KB, driven mostly by `## Don'ts` — 141 bullets carrying immutable
// [IL-nn] tags, each pinned to a real incident and never renumbered once shipped.
// #278 moved that section's full body (everything past the intro paragraph) out
// to docs/donts.md behind a short pointer, following the same extracted-doc
// convention as docs/plugin-structure.md and docs/skill-authoring.md; the rule
// text and its [IL-nn] tags are unchanged, only their always-loaded cost is gone.
// BUDGET_BYTES is measured-landing (20,840 B) rounded up to the next KiB (21 KiB
// = 21,504 B) plus 3 KiB headroom for the sections that remain.
// Lowering this budget as the file shrinks is encouraged; raising it is an
// explicit decision with the incident-log discipline behind it (ADR-0010 regrew
// 77% with nothing watching).
