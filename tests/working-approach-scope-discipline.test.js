// guide (platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/
// prompting-claude-fable-5-1) at its three plugin surfaces:
//
//   1. The Working Approach block in init's CLAUDE.md template — the rules an
//      /init-generated CLAUDE.md loads on every turn of a project session.
//   2. This repo's own CLAUDE.md, whose Working Approach section must stay
//      byte-conformant to that block under the same checker Update Mode runs
//      against adopting projects. Scoped to Working Approach only: the
//      `claude-tweaks Pipeline` section already differs from the template by
//      design (this repo carries its own Integration-model paragraph), and
//      the evals fixtures are frozen generator output, deliberately not synced.
//   3. /build's implementer injection, which quotes the same sentences into
//      implementer execution — pinned to the SAME literals as the template so
//      the two wordings cannot drift apart (docs/skill-graph.md, init → /build).
//
// Live-corpus read, per `[IL-80]`'s carve-out: the assertions pin shipped text
// that is itself the contract (Update Mode byte-compares it), so a fixture
// would only duplicate the template. The go-red control is in-test: the
// pre-change bullets are frozen below and asserted absent (`[IL-105]`).
