// that /claude-tweaks:feedback's terminal `## Next Actions` step renders as
// plain markdown and never forces an `AskUserQuestion` call. At the time #835
// was filed (plugin v6.87.0), this section's own closing-step logic asked
// "what next?" via `AskUserQuestion` even when the Recommended option already
// restated a next step the skill had fully determined. The repo-wide
// Interaction style banner every skill carries (pinned separately by
// tests/skill-conventions.test.js) states the general convention, but does
// not itself check that this skill's own Next Actions section complies —
// this test pins the section's own content directly, so a future edit to
// this skill specifically can't silently reintroduce the forced question.
