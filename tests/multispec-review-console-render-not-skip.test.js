// #642: the Auto-resolution short-circuit paragraph in
// skills/flow/multispec-review-console.md previously instructed both
// "render every section below as an informational report (nothing dropped)"
// AND "skip the console render and its AskUserQuestion entirely" in the same
// paragraph — a self-contradiction that made the audit surface vanish at
// `autonomy: unattended` (whichever clause the model followed, the operator
// saw either the full table or nothing). Fixed by aa7872c6 ("Fix
// consoleAutoResolve zero-render defect — rows stamped AUTO-RESOLVED",
// refs #714): the short-circuit now only skips the AskUserQuestion prompt,
// never the render. This test pins that the contradiction cannot reappear in
// either the multispec console or the single-spec wrap-up console (which
// carries the same short-circuit and was reworded in lockstep by the same
// commit, though its pre-fix wording never actually carried the offending
// clause).

Execute via "On approval" below; log one `AUTO {time} — Review Console: auto-resolved {item}. Reversibility: {…}.` line per item to the originating spec\'s `decisions.md` (or the parent\'s, for a parent-level item) instead of a user answer, retain every `staged/` file as a revert artifact rather than consuming it, and send **one** consolidated `PushNotification` for the whole run — not per spec, not per item — at the same point the single-spec auto-merge short-circuit sends its own FYI. Then proceed straight to Cleanup actions execution (Shared teardown below) and archive the parent run dir — skip the console render and its `AskUserQuestion` entirely.';
