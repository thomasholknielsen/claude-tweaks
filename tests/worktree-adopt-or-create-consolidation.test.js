// #1711: /flow's multi-spec shared-worktree Step 1 ("Create once, up front") had no
// "already isolated" detection before calling EnterWorktree(name=...) — under this
// project's own worktree-always policy, an interactive session is always already
// worktree-isolated by the time it reaches /flow, so that call refused every time.
// The workaround one session took (delegating the shared worktree to a Task subagent)
// traded that refusal for a second, unrecoverable one at teardown: a subagent holding
// the worktree cannot call ExitWorktree on it either. This spec extracts the detection
// already proven correct twice in this plugin (build/worktree-setup.md's Common Step 1,
// routine/create-and-update.md's Step 0) into one shared "Adopt-or-create" section in
// _shared/worktree-setup.md, wires flow/multi-spec.md's Step 1 to it (the actual fix),
// and migrates the two existing hand-rolled consumers to cite it instead of restating
// the detection logic inline.
