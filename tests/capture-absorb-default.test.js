// tests/capture-absorb-default.test.js
// Pins the "absorb-by-default" rules added to /capture's Immediate Routing
// (record #1264): absorb recommended as option 1 at high similarity, the
// two-criteria high-similarity definition, the multi-candidate tie-break,
// the headless structural bar and its fail-toward-filing default, bare-auto
// precedence, never-lower-size / never-write-priority, the three absorb
// exclusions, the 55,000-char body-vs-comment threshold, the AUTO log line,
// the `## Absorbed:` heading format, and the byte ceiling.
//
// #1295 split the absorb mechanics out of SKILL.md into routing.md (byte-
// ceiling relief) and completed the local-files driver mapping + the
// Immediate Routing / Workflow Step 1 ordering-prose alignment — most of the
// pins below now read routing.md instead of SKILL.md (path updates only, no
// assertion weakened); the two exceptions (the auto-mode-contract row test
// and the byte-ceiling test) still read their original targets unchanged.
