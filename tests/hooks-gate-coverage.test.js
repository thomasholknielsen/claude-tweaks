// tests/hooks-gate-coverage.test.js
//
// Binds the worktree.always gate's actual coverage to the prose that documents
// it. The gate was widened twice on 2026-07-20 (push in c8f929e1, cp/mv/tee in
// cab6142b) and neither commit swept the prose; four skill files went on
// describing the pre-widening gate, two of them prescribing procedures the
// widened gate denies (#138). Nothing failed, because nothing checked.
//
// This suite reads live production prose, which [IL-80] warns against — a test
// asserting "this real file currently contains X" is a scheduled failure timed
// to the next migration. It is acceptable HERE, and only here, because the
// coverage block is a declared contract whose update IS the intended action
// when the gate changes. Do not generalize the pattern to prose that merely
// happens to mention the gate.
