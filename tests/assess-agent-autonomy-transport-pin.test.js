// Conformance pin (#889, extracted #927): SKILL.md's Error Handling section must distinguish
// could-not-gather (transport/tooling failure) from gathered-but-inconclusive
// (a genuine content-ambiguity read) -- the two render different RATIONALE
// shapes. If SKILL.md's prose ever collapses this back into one case, this
// pin fails loudly instead of letting the distinction silently erode.
//
// #927 extracted the three-part gather-resilience shape (primary gather command -> MCP
// fallback via the issue_read mapping -> two could-not-gather short-circuits) that
// grant-check.md and failure-check.md each used to restate independently into a shared
// fragment, _gather-resilience.md. These pins now check both halves of that citation: that
// each mode file actually cites the fragment (rather than silently dropping the reference),
// and that the fragment itself still carries the shared shape's anchor phrases -- so reverting
// the fragment alone (deleting it, or blanking its could-not-gather section) fails these tests
// even though the citing mode files are untouched.
