// readCursors/writeCursors/recordAudit/readGapScanCursor/recordGapScan/

// by the health-state migration — cursors and run history now live on the
// durable health-state branch (bin/lib/health-core/durable-state.js), not
// local disk. The cursor-merge semantics these tests used to cover directly
// (set a per-target audit cursor, set the gap-scan cursor, leave unrelated
// cursor keys untouched) now live in the pure, separately-exported
// buildValidateFindingsUpdate (defined in this module, ../cache.js), which
// bin/harness-health.js's cmdValidateFindings hands to writeDurableState as
// its mutator. It is unit tested directly with plain-object fixtures in
// bin/lib/harness-health/tests/build-validate-findings-update.test.js — no
// git/gh involved. That extraction was necessary because
// bin/lib/harness-health/tests/durable-integration.test.js and the CLI-level
// tests in cli-validate-findings.test.js only ever exercise the read side
// (readDurableState) or a run that fails its `git fetch origin health-state`
// (no real GitHub-hosted remote configured in any test) and never actually
// invokes the mutator itself. The write path's own git/gh mechanics
// (blob/tree/commit/ref calls) are covered by
// bin/lib/health-core/tests/durable-state.test.js's fake-runner tests, using
// trivial synthetic mutators (not this one); those tests cannot be
// re-exercised for real without live GitHub credentials. computeChurn is a
// pure function shared with journey-health and is fully covered by
// bin/lib/health-core/tests/runs.test.js — no need to duplicate it here.
