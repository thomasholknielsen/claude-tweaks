// readCursors/writeCursors/recordAudit/readCoverageScanCursor/recordCoverageScan/

// live on the durable health-state branch
// (bin/lib/health-core/durable-state.js), not local disk. The cursor-merge
// semantics these tests used to cover directly (set a per-journey light/deep
// audit cursor without clobbering the sibling tier, set the coverage-scan
// cursor, leave unrelated cursor keys untouched) now live in the pure,
// separately-exported buildValidateFindingsUpdate (defined in this module,
// ../cache.js), which bin/journey-health.js's cmdValidateFindings hands to
// writeDurableState as its mutator. It is unit tested directly with
// plain-object fixtures in
// bin/lib/journey-health/tests/build-validate-findings-update.test.js — no
// git/gh involved. That extraction was necessary because
// bin/lib/journey-health/tests/durable-integration.test.js and the CLI-level
// tests in cli-validate-findings.test.js only ever exercise the read side
// (readDurableState) or a run that fails its `git fetch origin health-state`
// (no real GitHub-hosted remote configured in any test) and never actually
// invokes the mutator itself. The write path's own git/gh mechanics
// (blob/tree/commit/ref calls) are covered by
// bin/lib/health-core/tests/durable-state.test.js's fake-runner tests, using
// trivial synthetic mutators (not this one); those tests cannot be
// re-exercised for real without live GitHub credentials. computeChurn is a
// pure function shared with harness-health and is fully covered by
// bin/lib/health-core/tests/runs.test.js — no need to duplicate it here.
