// recordRun/readCursors/writeCursors (local-disk cursor persistence) were

// health-state branch (bin/lib/health-core/durable-state.js), not local disk.
// The cursor-merge semantics these tests used to cover directly (preserve an
// existing lastHash when an area isn't in areasSwept; only touch swept areas),
// plus the remembered-delta merge and run-history append, now live in the
// pure, separately-exported buildValidateFindingsUpdate (defined in this
// module, ../cache.js), which bin/code-health.js's cmdValidateFindings hands
// to writeDurableState as its mutator. It is unit tested directly with
// plain-object fixtures in
// tests/bin-lib/code-health/build-validate-findings-update.test.js — no
// git/gh involved. That extraction was necessary because durable-integration.test.js
// and tests/bin-lib/code-health/cli-nextslice.test.js only ever exercise the
// read side (readDurableState) or retry-queue drain: every CLI-level test
// that reaches cmdValidateFindings's persistence step fails its `git fetch
// origin health-state` first (no real GitHub-hosted remote configured in any
// test), so the mutator itself was never actually invoked by any prior test —
// despite an earlier version of this comment claiming otherwise. The write
// path's own git/gh mechanics (blob/tree/commit/ref calls) are covered by
// tests/bin-lib/health-core/durable-state.test.js's fake-runner tests, using
// trivial synthetic mutators (not this one); those tests cannot be
// re-exercised for real without live GitHub credentials.
