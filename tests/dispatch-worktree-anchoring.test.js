// #295 (closing #155) removed the "every group is a parallel Task agent that creates
// its own worktree" model from /claude-tweaks:dispatch Step 5: a Task-tool subagent is
// always launched cwd-pinned to the DISPATCHING session's worktree, so it can never get
// an independent one. The dispatching session now enters group N's worktree, dispatches
// group N's agent into that inherited cwd, waits for a terminal outcome, tears the
// worktree down, and only then enters group N+1's.
//
// The prose that actually executes is the literal Task() prompt inlined into every
// dispatched agent. A whole-branch review caught that prompt still saying "create your
// own worktree" — the exact instruction the fix exists to retire — while the surrounding
// narrative had already been rewritten. No test read skill prose, so nothing failed.
// This is that test: the forbidden phrasings below are the pre-fix wording, so an edit
// that reintroduces the retired model fails the suite instead of shipping a prompt that
// contradicts its own step.
//
// #296 later split the single Task() prompt into two sequential calls (build,test then
// review,polish,wrap-up) and extracted both templates out of SKILL.md into a sub-file,
// task-prompt.md, that SKILL.md's Step 5 now only stubs and points to ("read it and
// inline each call's content verbatim"). The anchoring assertions below moved with the
// content they check — reading only SKILL.md after that extraction would silently stop
// checking anything real, the same class of gap this file exists to prevent elsewhere.
//
// See CLAUDE.md's Don't: "Don't pass isolation: 'worktree' to the Agent tool when
// dispatching from inside a worktree already set up for the task ... Anchor to the
// existing path via the prompt."
