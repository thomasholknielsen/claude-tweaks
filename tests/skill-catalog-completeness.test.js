// reference-card.md (the command reference table), skills/help/context-flow.md
// (the Artifact Flow "What Each Skill Reads and Writes" table), and
// docs/getting-started.md (the onboarding narrative). Nothing enforced that a
// newly-added skill actually landed in all four -- confirmed drift at the time
// this test was written: 12 skills were missing from context-flow.md (the
// motivating issue claimed 13; a live grep found 12 -- trust the grep, not the
// issue body, `[IL-71]`), and `backlog` had no row in docs/plugin-structure.md's
// sub-file table despite shipping two mode files (fixed in the same change,
// see tests/skill-conventions.test.js for the sibling structural checks that
// file already carries).
//
// Directory names, not the frontmatter `name:` field, are the source of truth
// (mirrors tests/bin-lib/skill-audit/house-structure.test.js) -- a frontmatter
// typo would otherwise hide a skill from this test instead of failing it.
