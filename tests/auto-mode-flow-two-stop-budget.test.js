// tests/auto-mode-flow-two-stop-budget.test.js — #688: pins the two-stop bookend contract
// (`_shared/auto-mode-contract.md`: "skills MUST NOT invent new mid-flow stops in auto mode")
// against the actual auto-mode /flow prose path: flow/SKILL.md, flow/manifesto.md,
// wrap-up/review-console.md, flow/multispec-review-console.md.
//
// A real scan, not a shape match: it looks for genuine `AskUserQuestion` INVOCATION
// instructions ("call `AskUserQuestion`"), not every prose mention of the tool's name — a file
// can discuss the tool at length without adding a decision point. flow/manifesto.md,
// wrap-up/review-console.md, and flow/multispec-review-console.md are each wholesale-tagged
// (Manifesto / Review Console respectively) — their entire content IS one of the two contracted
// bookends, so every invocation inside them (terminal call, Override-drill sub-calls, the
// console-on-PR live-session accelerator) belongs to that one bookend, never a new stop.
// flow/SKILL.md is the mixed orchestration file: HARD-GATE stops and failure cards are real,
// permitted mid-flow stops (`_shared/auto-mode-contract.md`'s "What auto does NOT silence"), so
// an invocation near either marker is exempt too — anything else there is the invented third
// stop the contract forbids.
