# Criteria: Simplification

Shared, criteria-only fragment — the "what is worth simplifying" knowledge. No workflow, no subagent dispatch, no Next Actions. Consumed by `/claude-tweaks:simplify` (the reactive cleanup pass, which dispatches `code-simplifier:code-simplifier`) and by `/claude-tweaks:code-health`'s simplification judgment lens (Phase 2 subagents). One source of truth so a reactive cleanup and a proactive sweep flag the same kinds of complexity.

## What is worth flagging

- Unnecessary complexity from iterative development
- Verbose patterns from trial-and-error debugging
- Leftover defensive code from abandoned approaches
- Inconsistent naming or structure across changed files
- Dead paths, redundant conditionals, over-abstraction
- Cross-file / cross-task patterns (when multiple changes touched related files):
  - Inconsistent naming or patterns between files modified by different tasks
  - Opportunities to consolidate similar code written by different authors/subagents
  - Unnecessary complexity that accumulated across iterative implementation

## Constraints (what NOT to flag)

- **Preserve all behavior** — simplification never changes behavior. If behavior needs changing, that is a different concern, not a simplification finding.
- **Stay in scope** — only the changed files. Never flag unrelated code.
- **Don't over-simplify at the cost of readability** — simpler isn't always better. Dense one-liners can be harder to read than explicit code; a clarity loss is not a simplification.
- **Don't simplify generated files** — generated code is regenerated, not hand-simplified.
