# Phase 3's ledger gate — Nothing Left Behind (wrap-up's wrapper around the resolve gate)

Loaded by `/claude-tweaks:wrap-up`'s Phase 3 ledger gate under the same condition that gates `_shared/ledger-format.md`'s Resolve Gate section: the ledger exists and holds at least one item, of any status. Holds the requirements the resolve gate runs under here, the terminal-status bulk-resolve fast path, and the ops-acknowledgment sub-step.

The gate is item-*existence*, not open-item-existence: the bulk-resolve fast path below still stages proposals for `acknowledged` items via that file's Phase 3 `Acknowledge` disposition, and the Ops acknowledgment sub-step below applies the same disposition — both operate on items that are already terminal. Gating on `open` items alone would skip the read while those two paths still need it.

**Hard requirements:**

- Phase 1 must run before any user-facing output. The agent fixes everything that qualifies for fix-now, commits, then presents only the genuine residue.
- Phase 2 always requires explicit per-item user input for `fix` / `defer` / `accept` decisions. Status `acknowledged` (e.g., ops items the user has read — each one stages a work record proposal, resolved by the run's own Queue writes surface under `_shared/auto-mode-contract.md`'s tiered stance (Review Console "Approve all" at supervised/trusted; zero-click `consoleAutoResolve` at unattended) — see the sub-step below for which surface that is) is *staged* via `_shared/batched-item-drill.md`'s multiSelect chunking — a checkbox per item, pre-checked to Acknowledge — since the actual record creation still gets its own downstream approval per that tiered stance. Never bulk-resolve `fix` / `defer` / `accept`. Never assume "obvious" defers. Never offer a "Fix all (Recommended)" or "Defer all" shortcut — those bias the user toward whichever bulk action is easier to type. Ops-ack's per-item checkbox is not such a shortcut: unchecking an item is a real, individually-attended choice, not a shared bulk toggle.
- `auto` mode does NOT silence this gate.
- Both `parked` and `backlog` are valid stage destinations for a new work record, but every individual item requires an explicit per-item user choice — no record is ever staged autonomously.

### Bulk-resolve fast path (terminal-status only)

The fast path applies **only when every ledger item already has terminal status** (`fixed`, `deferred`, `accepted`, `acknowledged`, `observation`) at gate entry. If a single item has status `open`, the fast path does NOT apply — Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 must run in full sequence without exception. Before reporting completion, check every `acknowledged` item for a staged proposal (a producer can create an item pre-set to `acknowledged`, bypassing Phase 3 entirely — e.g. `build/worktree-setup.md`'s auto-mode divergence entry): stage one now, per `_shared/ledger-format.md`'s Resolve Gate Phase 3 `Acknowledge` disposition, for any that lack one. Then report: "All {N} ledger items resolved. No open items." and proceed to Phase 4.

Phase 2 is on the "What `auto` does NOT silence" list in `_shared/auto-mode-card.md` — it is never skipped, regardless of `auto` state, when any `open` item exists.

### Ops acknowledgment (when ops items exist)

Ops items represent infrastructure changes the user needs to action post-merge — bulk-acknowledging them risks the user not reading them. Present each item, and require explicit confirmation rather than a shortcut that defaults to bulk action:

```
The following ops items need acknowledgment. These represent infrastructure changes you need to action post-merge — read each one before choosing:

| # | What | Where |
|---|------|-------|
| 1 | {description} | {source} |
```

**Autonomy auto-acknowledge:** resolve the `ceiling` per `_shared/autonomy-ceiling.md`'s existing
precedence ladder. If `bookkeepingPermissions(ceiling).opsAckAutoAcknowledge === true`
(`bin/lib/issues/autonomy.js` — gated at `unattended`, the tier that also skips acknowledging a
post-merge infrastructure follow-up, not just a reversible bookkeeping item), skip the drill below
entirely — for every item, stage a record proposal and update status to `acknowledged` per
`_shared/ledger-format.md`'s Resolve Gate Phase 3 `Acknowledge` disposition, log
`AUTO {time} — Ops acknowledgment: {N} items auto-acknowledged, staged for filing. Reversibility: high.` to
`decisions.md`, and continue to Phase 4's Review Console. Otherwise, present the drill below.

Resolve each item's acknowledgment via `_shared/batched-item-drill.md`'s multiSelect chunking
(genuinely binary: Acknowledge vs. defer to a follow-up) — one `multiSelect: true`
`AskUserQuestion` call per chunk of ≤4 items, all pre-checked to `Acknowledge` (the recommended
default — these are read-and-confirm items, not judgment calls); unchecking an item defers it
instead, leaving it `open` for a later run's Phase 2 drill:

- `question`: `"These ops items need acknowledgment — you need to action them post-merge. Read each one before submitting. (checked = Acknowledge, uncheck to defer)"`, `header`: `"Ops items"`, each checkbox option's label the item's own short description

After a chunk resolves, apply `_shared/ledger-format.md`'s Resolve Gate Phase 3 `Acknowledge` disposition to every checked item — stage a record proposal per item and update status to `acknowledged`. The actual record creation is a separate approval at the Review Console's Queue writes section — folded into "Approve all" at supervised/trusted, auto-resolved with zero `AskUserQuestion` calls under `consoleAutoResolve` at unattended, per `_shared/auto-mode-contract.md`'s tiered stance (this drill only stages the proposal; it does not silently create N records). An unchecked item's status stays `open` — it is not acknowledged, and remains subject to a later resolve-gate pass rather than silently dropped.
