name: claude-tweaks:routine
description: Use when you want to create, update, or check the status of a Claude Code cloud Routine for a claude-tweaks skill — instantiates a versioned, project-agnostic routine template (e.g. recon's) into a live, account-and-project-specific scheduled routine via the RemoteTrigger API. Keywords - routine, schedule, cron, cloud agent, recurring, automation.
---
> **Interaction style:** Present decisions as numbered options so the user can reply with just a number. For multi-item decisions, present a table with recommended actions and offer "apply all / override." Never present more than one batch decision table per message — resolve each before showing the next. End skills with a Next Actions block (context-specific numbered options with one recommended), not a navigation menu.

# Routine — Instantiate Versioned Cloud Routines

Turns a skill's plugin-shipped routine template into a live Claude Code cloud Routine for the current project — resolving the account- and project-specific values (environment, repo) that a portable template can't hardcode, then driving the `RemoteTrigger` API directly. Skips `/schedule`'s own conversational flow entirely: the template already has the answers.

```
              [ /claude-tweaks:routine ] <- utility (no fixed lifecycle position)
                           |  reads {skill}/routine-template.yml
                           v
template + resolved project/account values -> RemoteTrigger create/update -> .claude-tweaks/routines/{name}.yml
```

## When to Use

- You want a skill's documented "Routine Configuration" to become a real, live scheduled cloud Routine instead of a manual `/schedule` walkthrough.
- You want that routine's config captured as a versioned, reproducible project artifact — not something that only exists in claude.ai's UI.
- You're setting up the same kind of routine (e.g. recon) in a new project and want it created the same way every time, without re-answering `/schedule`'s interactive questions from scratch.

Not for: one-off or exploratory routines you don't want templated (use `/schedule` directly). Not a replacement for `/schedule`'s `list`/`run` conveniences or for deleting a routine — deletion has no API and always happens at claude.ai/code/routines.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS`:

| Argument | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `create <skill>` | Instantiate `<skill>`'s routine template into a live routine for the current project. Routes to the UPDATE workflow automatically if an instantiated record already exists for this project+skill. |
| `update <skill>` | Re-sync an existing routine against its (possibly changed) template. |
| `status <skill>` | Show the instantiated record alongside live routine state. |
| `--dry-run` (combine with `create`/`update`) | Assemble and display the `RemoteTrigger` body; never call the tool, never write or rewrite the instantiated record. |

## Workflow

### CREATE `<skill>`

**Step 1 — Load the template.** Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/{skill}/routine-template.yml`. If it doesn't exist, stop: "`{skill}` has no routine-template.yml — it doesn't support routines yet." The field schema is documented once in `skills/_shared/routine-template-schema.md` — read it if any field's meaning is unclear.

**Step 2 — Idempotency check.** Check whether `.claude-tweaks/routines/{routine_name}.yml` already exists in the current project (`routine_name` from the template). If it does, stop this workflow and continue at UPDATE below instead — never create a second routine for the same project+skill.

**Step 3 — Resolve the repo URL.**

```bash
git remote get-url origin
```

Normalize to full HTTPS the same way `/schedule` does: accept `org/repo`, `git@github.com:org/repo.git`, or `https://github.com/org/repo` and produce `https://github.com/{org}/{repo}` (strip any `.git` suffix, convert the SSH form). If the command fails (no `origin` remote, not a git repo, etc.), stop and ask the user for the repo URL directly instead of proceeding with an empty or invalid value.

**Step 4 — Resolve `environment_id`.** Load the tool with `ToolSearch select:RemoteTrigger`, then call `{action: "list"}`. If existing routines are returned, read `job_config.ccr.environment_id` off the most recently created one and offer it as the default (let the user override). If none exist yet, ask the user directly which environment to use — present whatever environment names/IDs are available in context; if none are, ask the user to name one (they can check via `/schedule` once if unsure). Do not cache this value anywhere under `~/.claude-tweaks/` — that path is harness-owned, not skill-owned.

**Step 5 — Resolve the schedule.** Present the template's `default_schedule.cron_expression` (always UTC) and ask the user to confirm it actually lands off-peak in their own timezone, or supply a different cron expression. Use the same UTC-conversion-and-confirm discipline `/schedule` itself uses: state the conversion explicitly ("9am Europe/Copenhagen = 7am UTC, so `0 7 * * *`") before locking it in. Minimum interval is 1 hour — reject anything tighter and ask for a looser schedule.

**Step 6 — Assemble the `RemoteTrigger create` body.**

```json
{
  "name": "<template.routine_name>",
  "cron_expression": "<resolved cron, UTC>",
  "job_config": {
    "ccr": {
      "environment_id": "<resolved environment_id>",
      "session_context": {
        "model": "<template.model>",
        "sources": [{"git_repository": {"url": "<resolved repo URL>"}}],
        "allowed_tools": <template.allowed_tools, verbatim — this is already an array, e.g. ["Bash", "Read", "Grep", "Glob"], do not add another layer of brackets>
      },
      "events": [{"data": {
        "uuid": "<fresh lowercase v4 UUID, generated now>",
        "session_id": "",
        "type": "user",
        "parent_tool_use_id": null,
        "message": {"content": "<template.prompt>", "role": "user"}
      }}]
    }
  }
}
```

If `template.mcp_connections` is non-empty, add a top-level `mcp_connections` array with `{connector_uuid, name, url}` entries (same shape `/schedule` uses) — warn the user if a named connector isn't currently connected, and direct them to https://claude.ai/customize/connectors.

**Step 7 — Review gate.** Show the full assembled body before doing anything with it. This creates live, billed infrastructure with no delete API — always confirm explicitly here, regardless of how automated everything upstream was.

If `--dry-run` was passed: print the assembled body and stop. Do not call `RemoteTrigger`. Do not write an instantiated record.

**Step 8 — Create.** Call `RemoteTrigger {action: "create", body: <assembled body>}`. Read the routine/trigger ID and the claude.ai routine URL from the response (the tool appends a summary line with both).

**Step 9 — Write the instantiated record.** Write `.claude-tweaks/routines/{routine_name}.yml`:

```yaml
routine_id: "<id from the create response>"
template: <skill>
template_version: <template.template_version>
created_at: "<current UTC timestamp, ISO 8601>"
schedule: "<resolved cron_expression>"
console_url: "<url from the create response>"
```

Report the console URL to the user.
