# Design Mode — test

Invoked via `/claude-tweaks:design-wrapper test <files>`. Returns `{mode, result, files_scanned, findings}` or `{mode, skipped, ...}` to caller.

## When this runs

Called by `/claude-tweaks:test` after the standard verification suite (types/lint/tests). Acts as a frontend anti-pattern gate via the deterministic Impeccable CLI. Findings carrying `advisory === true` do not fail the gate; any other finding does. Skips do not fail the gate either.

## Preconditions

Run the universal preconditions from `../SKILL.md` (all three detection layers). Availability is mode-specific here — `test` mode requires the Impeccable CLI, not the plugin's LLM commands: `npx impeccable --version` must exit 0. On failure, return skip with `install_hint: "npm install -g impeccable (verify with npx impeccable --version)"`.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Run preconditions

Run all three detection layers + availability. On any skip, return the skip object immediately.

### Step 1.5: Native surface — skip explicitly

Read `surface_track` from the track resolution in `../SKILL.md`'s Step 1. When it is `ios`, `android`, or `adaptive`, return immediately:

```json
{ "mode": "test", "skipped": "native surface — CLI detector is web-only", "surface_track": "<ios|android|adaptive>" }
```

**`pass` is not available on this path**, and the distinction is the whole point of the step. The bundled detector is an HTML rule engine — upstream states the constraint itself in `reference/routing.md`: *"`live` and the bundled `detect.mjs` are web-only."* Run against SwiftUI, Compose, Flutter, or React Native source it does not find zero problems; it finds zero *of the problems it knows how to look for*, which is a different sentence. Reporting that as `pass` is a gate that cannot fail — the defect this mode's CLI contract was rewritten to remove, reappearing on the surface axis.

The skip must happen **here**, before Step 2 resolves targets and before Step 4 invokes the CLI. A native check placed after the CLI has already run would be deciding what to call a result it should never have produced.

Callers already handle this: `skipped` is a first-class return category in `_shared/design-wrapper-handling.md`, and `/claude-tweaks:test`'s `design-gate.md` maps `{skipped: ...}` to "note the skip in test output and proceed." No caller treats this mode's return as binary pass/fail, so no caller changes.

### Step 2: Resolve target files

If `<files>` was passed, use that list. Otherwise run `git diff --name-only` to collect uncommitted changes (staged + unstaged). If that command itself fails (non-git directory, git error, mid-rebase state), return `{skipped: "unable to resolve target files (git diff failed)"}` immediately — see `../SKILL.md`'s Input section for this shared fallback-failure rule.

### Step 3: Filter to frontend files

Apply the Layer 3 sniff rules from `../frontend-detection.md` to drop non-frontend files. If zero files remain after filtering, return `{skipped: "no frontend files in scope"}`.

### Step 4: Invoke the CLI

Invoke the CLI exactly as specified in `../impeccable-cli.md` ("Invocation"), and derive `pass` / `fail` from its "Advisory-to-result mapping". The flags and the parse are deliberately not restated here — three copies of this contract is what let it drift.

### Step 5: Parse JSON output

1. Capture stdout and the process exit code from Step 4's invocation.
2. Exit code `1`, or stdout that fails to parse as JSON → malformed; return the malformed-output skip object from `../impeccable-cli.md` immediately; do not proceed to Step 6.
3. Otherwise (exit code `0` or `2`) → parse stdout as JSON per `../impeccable-cli.md`'s defensive parsing rules into normalized findings. The exit code carries no findings signal beyond distinguishing ran from crashed — an advisory-only scan exits `0` with a non-empty findings array, so treating exit `0` as "zero findings" would silently discard it.

`files_scanned` is the count of files in the list resolved by Steps 2-3 — the CLI's own output never includes this field.

### Step 6: Compute pass/fail

- **pass** — zero findings, or every finding carries `advisory === true`
- **fail** — any finding without `advisory === true`

Findings carrying `advisory === true` are included in the findings list but do not cause `result: fail`. Callers may surface them informationally.

## Output to caller

```json
{
  "mode": "test",
  "result": "pass" | "fail",
  "files_scanned": <int>,
  "findings": [ /* each finding has the shape documented in ../impeccable-cli.md's field reference — not restated here */ ]
}
```

Or on skip:

```json
{ "mode": "test", "skipped": "<reason>", "install_hint": "<when availability>" }
```

Both shapes additionally carry the wrapper's standard top-level `platform` / `surface_track` fields — see `../SKILL.md`'s Output contract. They are not restated here.
