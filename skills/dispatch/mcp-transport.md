# Dispatch — GitHub MCP Transport (`gh` absent)

Loaded by `/claude-tweaks:dispatch` only when Preflight's Detection Ladder check 2 resolves `gh` as
absent. Every call site in `SKILL.md` runs its `gh` CLI form unchanged when `gh` is present, so a
normal run never reads this file.

Live as of Task 10 of **the bridge plan** — `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-02-dispatch-mcp-bridge.md`,
deleted `d83f0720`, and referred to by that short name for the rest of this file — which verified the
whole chain against a live cloud run and flipped Preflight's check 2 from a hard gate to a branch.
CRUD mappings throughout are per `_shared/github-write-transport.md`. Settle and the Auto-merge gate
have their own MCP notes in `settle-and-merge.md`; the self-report block's MCP mapping lives with
that block, in `headless-self-report.md`.

## Preflight — check 3 on the MCP transport

When `gh` is absent, check 3 (authenticated + repo reachable) is
satisfied via a bounded `list_issues` call (e.g. `list_issues {owner, repo, state: "open", perPage:
1}`) — a lightweight, confirmed-working read (per the bridge plan's Task 2 live verification)
that fails identically to `gh repo view --json owner,name` when auth or
repo access is broken. This is dispatch-specific documentation: only dispatch treats check 3 as a
hard gate that needs an MCP equivalent — `_shared/github-pr-scan.md` itself defines check 3 purely
as `gh repo view`, unchanged, since its other consumers (`/help`, `/tidy`) fail-open on this ladder
and don't need one.

## Preflight — why check 2 no longer gates on its own

Check 2 no longer gates on its own as of the bridge plan's Task 10 — every call site that used to be
`gh`-only end to end (Step 2's queue pull and dependency checks, the contested-claim comment
fetch, all of `settle-and-merge.md`) now has a confirmed, live-verified MCP path (its Tasks 1-2
diagnostic Routine). A prior attempt at this same bridge (`274e30e`, reverted the next day as `d4bdfb9`) shipped this
exact gate change without finishing the read-path bridge first, producing an unstructured
`gh: command not found` crash instead of a clean stop — this version does not repeat that
mistake, since every call site was bridged and verified before this line changed.

## Step 2 — queue pull and per-dependency open-state check

The queue pull uses the confirmed "list issues by label" mapping; the per-dependency open-state check (the `gh issue view "$DEP" --json state` loop) uses the confirmed "get single issue by number" mapping, checking the returned state field for `OPEN`. Both replace their `gh`-CLI equivalent one-for-one — no change to the surrounding `node -e` eligibility/dependency logic, which only consumes the fetched JSON shape, not how it was fetched.
