# Multi-Spec Summary Template

Loaded at summary-render time by `/flow`'s consolidated close-out.

After all specs complete (or one fails), present a consolidated summary:

```markdown
## Flow: Multi-Spec Pipeline Complete  {— keep-going if applicable}

| Spec | Build | Test | Review | Polish | Wrap-Up | Outcome |
|------|-------|------|--------|--------|---------|---------|
| {N} | passed | passed | PASS | applied + re-verified | done | Complete |
| {N} | passed | passed | PASS | skipped (no-polish) | done | Complete (no polish) |
| {N} | passed | passed | BLOCKED | — | — | Stopped at review |
| {N} | passed | passed | PASS | re-verify failed | — | Stopped at re-verify |
| {N} | passed | FAILED | — | — | — | Failed (test gate) — continued (keep-going) |
| {N} | — | — | — | — | — | Not run (previous spec failed) |

### Manual Steps Required (all specs)
| # | Spec | What | Where |
|---|------|------|-------|
| 1 | {N} | {description} | {source} |
(or: No manual steps required.)

### Per-Spec Details
(expand each spec's key outputs, failures, and review findings)
```

The header includes `— keep-going` when the run was invoked with that flag. The outcome column distinguishes:
- `Complete` — all gates passed
- `Stopped at {step}` — HARD-GATE failure, remaining specs not run (default mode)
- `Failed ({gate}) — continued (keep-going)` — HARD-GATE failure but pipeline continued to the next spec
- `Not run (previous spec failed)` — only appears in default mode; never under `keep-going`
