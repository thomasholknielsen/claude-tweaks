# Recover from a Bookkeeping-Stamp Deny

**Persona:** a build agent (human or automated) working inside a claude-tweaks pipeline worktree, mid-way through `/claude-tweaks:build`'s Spec Step 1 — having just materialized a spec and judged (correctly or not) that no further implementation is needed.
**Goal:** when a covered Edit/Write/NotebookEdit or `git` write is denied because the run's `record-worktree` or (under `integration-model: pr-first`) PR-early stamp never landed, recover in one step — without following a remediation command that could corrupt a live sibling session's state.
**Entry point:** any covered tool call (`Edit`, `Write`, `NotebookEdit`, or a `git` write — commit/push/mv/update-ref/rm/apply/update-index/commit-tree, `GATE_COVERAGE.gitActions`) issued inside a linked worktree after this run's materialize commit has landed, while `run-state.json`'s `worktree` or `pr` field is still unset — with one carve-out on the `pr` branch (#989): a Bash `git push` whose every target is establishing that branch's upstream tracking ref for the first time **is** `_shared/pr-early-run-lifecycle.md` Step 2 itself, so it is exempt from the PR-stamp deny and simply succeeds. The exemption is one-shot and never memoized as `prExempt`, so a later push of an already-tracked branch with still no recorded PR is denied normally; and it never covers the worktree stamp — a missing `record-worktree` still denies that same push.
**Success state:** the missing stamp is recorded (or, for the PR branch, the degrade is logged to `decisions.md`) from the owning session, and the identical tool call now succeeds — or, for a genuinely foreign-owned run, the agent heeds the warning and never runs a stamp-writing command against state it doesn't own.

## Steps

### 1. Attempt the call that trips the gate — worktree session
- **URL:** any `Edit`/`Write`/`NotebookEdit`/`git commit`/`git push` call issued from inside the worktree
- **Action:** proceed with implementation (or a "nothing further to implement" judgment) exactly as before — the gate is invisible until it actually has something to catch.
- **Should feel:** unchanged from before this record — the fast path (`plugin/bin/lib/hooks/pre-tool-use.js`'s I5 early return) means a run with both stamps already recorded pays no extra cost and sees no new behavior.
- **Should understand:** the gate only engages once THIS run's own materialize commit has landed — Common Step 1 running normally is never mistaken for a skip.
- **Red flags:** a deny on a run whose materialize commit has not landed yet (Common Step 1 legitimately still in progress) — that would be the gate itself misfiring, not a real gap. Since #989, a **PR-stamp** deny on the run's initial publish push (the branch has no upstream tracking ref yet) is the same misfire class — that push is exempt by design (`hasNoUpstreamYet`); a PR-stamp deny on a *later* push of an already-tracked branch, or a **worktree-stamp** deny on any push, is correct behavior and belongs in Step 2.

### 2. Read the deny — same terminal
- **URL:** the tool call's own denial message (`hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecisionReason`)
- **Action:** read which stamp is missing and the exact remediation command the message names — `record-worktree --run "{run-dir}" "{worktree}"` for the worktree stamp, or a pointer to log the PR-early degrade line via `bin/log-decision.js` for the PR stamp.
- **Should feel:** diagnosed, not stonewalled — the message names the specific non-skippable step (`build/worktree-setup.md` Step 4.5 or the PR-early lifecycle) and cites `[IL-131]`, not a generic "denied."
- **Should understand:** this is the same incident the bolded prose in `build/SKILL.md` already warned about — the message exists precisely because that prose alone had already been silently skipped twice.
- **Red flags:** a deny with no remediation command; a remediation command that doesn't match either sanctioned stamp-writing path.

### 3. Check whether this is genuinely your own run — same terminal
- **URL:** the deny (or, on a foreign-owned run, a warning instead) itself
- **Action:** if the message reads as a *warning* ("allowing this call because it comes from a different session") rather than a deny, stop — do not run the remediation command anyway. A provable ownership mismatch downgrades the gate to a warning specifically so this command is never handed out against a run you don't own.
- **Should feel:** protective, not permissive — a warning here is the gate declining to give risky advice, not the gate stepping aside.
- **Should understand:** `docs/hooks.md`'s own rule (omitting `--run` on `record-worktree` can silently corrupt a different live session's `run-state.json`) is exactly the hazard this check exists to prevent.
- **Red flags:** running `record-worktree`/logging a degrade against a run you did not start, on the strength of a warning message alone.

### 4. Run the remediation, from the owning session — worktree session
- **URL:** `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/hooks.js" record-worktree --run "{run-dir}" "{worktree}"`, or `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/log-decision.js" --run "{run-dir}" --status AUTO --text "PR-early run lifecycle: ... FAILED" --section "/build"` for a genuine push/PR-create failure
- **Action:** run exactly the command the deny named, from the session that actually owns this run.
- **Should feel:** a one-line unblock, not a debugging session — the command is paste-ready and idempotent (`record-worktree` is documented as a safe restamp).
- **Should understand:** the PR-stamp path is a graceful degrade, not a second enforcement layer — a genuinely failed push/PR-create is meant to be logged and moved past, never forced into existing anyway.
- **Red flags:** inventing a different command; retrying the original call without running either remediation first.

### 5. Retry the original call — same terminal
- **URL:** the exact same `Edit`/`Write`/`git commit`/`git push` call from Step 1
- **Action:** re-issue it.
- **Should feel:** ordinary — identical to a call that never hit the gate.
- **Should understand:** the gate re-checks `run-state.json` fresh on every call, so the fix from Step 4 is picked up immediately, no restart needed.
- **Red flags:** the retry still denying after the remediation genuinely ran from the owning session (a real gap, not documented behavior — worth its own report).

## Origin
- Created during build of #991 — the mechanical backstop for IL-131's recurring gap (a build agent's own "already satisfied by prior work" judgment silently skipping the `record-worktree` and PR-early stamps despite existing bolded prose in `build/SKILL.md`).
- Related records: #991, #118, #893, #778 (a related-but-distinct fix for a structural dispatch-created-worktree skip path, not the same trigger as this journey).
