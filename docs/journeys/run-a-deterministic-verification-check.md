# Run a Deterministic Verification Check Through bin/verify.js

**Persona:** claude-tweaks skill author (or a maintainer of a project using the plugin) who wants proof that `verification.md`'s migrated Step 2 invocation actually produces bounded output and a trustworthy `report.json` — rather than trusting the skill's prose to have described the CLI's behavior correctly.
**Goal:** Watch the runner execute a mix of passing, failing, and fail-fast-skipped checks, and confirm stdout stays bounded, exit codes key off each check's own result, and `report.json` carries the evidence `VERIFICATION_PASSED`/`VERIFICATION_SHA` downstream consumers rely on.
**Entry point:** A terminal at a project checkout root, `plugin/bin/verify.js` reachable (this repo's own checkout, or another project's resolved plugin root per `docs/skill-authoring.md`'s plugin-root contract).
**Success state:** A markdown results table on stdout with one row per check plus at most one bounded failing region, a `report.json` whose `pass`/`sha`/`dirty`/`checks` fields match what actually ran, and a non-zero process exit exactly when something failed.

## Steps

### 1. Run the reserved three-stage set — terminal
- **URL:** `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/verify.js" --cmd types="tsc --noEmit" --cmd lint="eslint ." --cmd tests="npm test"`
- **Action:** Run against a project that supplies all three reserved names.
- **Should feel:** One command replacing the old prose-orchestrated capture recipe — no `LOG=`, no `tail`, no `grep` pipeline to hand-assemble, and (since #1921) no `$(git rev-parse --git-dir)` substitution either.
- **Should understand:** `types` and `lint` start concurrently; `tests` only starts once every supplied one of them has exited 0. A stage-1 failure reports `tests` as `skipped: fail-fast` in both the stdout table and `report.json` — never silently dropped, never spawned anyway. Inside a git checkout the runner resolves `--log-dir` itself to `{git-dir}/claude-tweaks-verify` (per-worktree, never the common dir); pass `--log-dir` explicitly only to relocate the logs, and expect a fresh `claude-tweaks-verify-` tmpdir outside any checkout.
- **Red flags:** `tests` spawning before `types`/`lint` finish; a `types` failure that still lets `tests` run; a raw `npm test` log (megabytes of TAP output) landing on stdout instead of a bounded summary.

### 2. Read the bounded stdout, not the log file
- **URL:** the same command's own stdout
- **Action:** Point a check's command at something that fails loudly (e.g. `--cmd tests="node -e \"process.exit(1)\""`), then read what the runner prints.
- **Should feel:** Legible in one screen — a status table plus, only for a failing check, one capped failing-region excerpt (≤100 lines, each line truncated past 500 characters).
- **Should understand:** The full, unbounded output still exists — one plain-text log file per check under `--log-dir` (`{name}.log`) — the runner's own stdout is a summary, never a copy. The trailing `report: {path}` line survives for a reader that consumes all of stdout (`| cat`, `| tee`), because the runner sets `process.exitCode` and lets Node drain pending writes rather than calling `process.exit()` mid-flush. A reader that closes early (`| head`) legitimately truncates the output instead — the runner's EPIPE guard exits quietly rather than crashing.
- **Red flags:** A truncated table with no trailing `report:` line when the reader consumed all of stdout; a failing region that's actually the whole raw log; an EPIPE crash (a raw stack trace) when piped into an early-closing reader.

### 3. Read report.json's evidence fields
- **URL:** `cat {log-dir}/report.json` after Step 1 or 2
- **Action:** Inspect `pass`, `sha`, `dirty`, and each entry under `checks`.
- **Should feel:** Machine-readable proof, not a narrated claim — this is what turns `VERIFICATION_PASSED`/`VERIFICATION_SHA` (the values `/build` and `/test` pass between pipeline steps) into evidence instead of prose.
- **Should understand:** `sha` is `git rev-parse HEAD` — outside a git repository it (and `dirty`) is `null`; `dirty: true` means "verified this tree, which is not exactly commit `sha`" — never trust `sha` alone on a dirty tree. Every non-skipped check's entry carries `counts: {tests, pass, fail}` whenever its output parses (TAP, jest/vitest, pytest) — including a failing check, not only a passing one; an unparseable or ambiguous summary omits `counts` entirely rather than guessing. A check that couldn't even spawn records `exitCode: null` plus a `spawnError` string rather than a `counts` block.
- **Red flags:** `counts` present with a fabricated or guessed value; `pass: true` while a supplied check's `exitCode` is non-zero or `null`; `report.json` missing or half-written after a run that was interrupted mid-flight (the write is atomic — temp file then rename — so this should never happen).

### 4. Add an unknown check name
- **URL:** `node plugin/bin/verify.js --log-dir /tmp/verify-demo --cmd tests="npm test" --cmd smoke="./scripts/smoke.sh"`
- **Action:** Supply a `--cmd` name outside the reserved `types`/`lint`/`tests` set.
- **Should feel:** Extensible without a spec change — any project-specific check rides along under the same ordering discipline.
- **Should understand:** Unknown names run serially, after the known stages, in the order given, subject to the same fail-fast rule — a failing `tests` skips `smoke`, and a failing `smoke` (if there were a second unknown check after it) would skip that one too.
- **Red flags:** An unknown check running before `tests` finishes; an unknown check's failure not fail-fasting a later unknown check.

### 5. Trigger a usage error
- **URL:** `node plugin/bin/verify.js --log-dir /tmp/verify-demo --cmd "smoke:e2e=echo hi"`
- **Action:** Supply a malformed `--cmd` — an invalid name (must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`), a duplicate name, an empty command, a missing flag value, or an unknown flag.
- **Should feel:** Fails fast and explains itself — no checks spawn, no `report.json` is written.
- **Should understand:** A malformed invocation prints the specific problem plus the usage line to stderr and exits `2`, before anything runs. `--json <path>` relocates the report away from the `{log-dir}/report.json` default used elsewhere in this journey — pass it when a caller needs the report at a fixed, predictable path.
- **Red flags:** Any check spawning despite a malformed invocation; an exit code other than `2` for a usage error.

### 6. Watch a quieter suite surface as a caveat, not a silent pass
- **URL:** two consecutive runs sharing one `--count-stamp` path, e.g. `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/verify.js" --log-dir /tmp/verify-demo1 --count-stamp "$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/claude-tweaks-test-count.json" --cmd tests="npm test"`, then again with fewer tests actually running (e.g. after narrowing a glob)
- **Action:** Compare the first run's stdout/`report.json` against the second's.
- **Should feel:** A quieter suite is impossible to miss — the CAVEAT reads as its own paragraph, distinct from the pass/fail table, not buried in a check's `summary` field.
- **Should understand:** IL-84 (`docs/incident-log.md`) is what this closes: an enumerated-glob `npm test` config once silently excluded a whole test directory while still exiting 0, so under-coverage read identical to a clean pass. `--count-stamp` persists the `tests` check's own parsed count (`extract.js`'s `parseCounts`) across runs; a strict drop between consecutive runs prints a `CAVEAT: test count dropped from {previous} to {current} …` line on stdout and sets `report.json`'s `testCountRegression: {previousTests, currentTests, droppedBy}` — without flipping `report.pass`, since a legitimate test removal also drops the count. Outside a checkout, omitting `--count-stamp` disables persistence and comparison entirely — no stamp file, no caveat, ever; inside a checkout, `--count-stamp` defaults to `{git-dir}/claude-tweaks-test-count.json` (#1921), so persistence and comparison happen automatically unless `--count-stamp` is overridden.
- **Red flags:** A count drop that silently passes with no CAVEAT line; a count drop that fails the run outright (this is a caveat, not a gate); a stamp-write failure (e.g. `--count-stamp` pointing at an unwritable path) that crashes the whole run and discards `report.json` even though every check passed — the write is best-effort and must degrade to "no baseline persisted," never to a lost report.

### 7. Read the pass stamp, then confirm --stamp-status agrees
- **URL:** `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/verify.js" --cmd tests="npm test"` followed by `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/verify.js" --stamp-status`
- **Action:** Run the full resolved check set to a passing result inside a git checkout, then read `{git-dir}/claude-tweaks-verify-pass.json` and separately run `--stamp-status`.
- **Should feel:** The pass stamp is the runner's own artifact, not something a skill or agent hand-writes — `verification.md`'s Step 2.5 states this is the only writer (#1921, closing #1784's agent-written-stamp gap).
- **Should understand:** A passing run of every supplied `--cmd` check (none fail-fast skipped) writes `{sha, dirty, scope: "full", fullSha, base: null, changedFiles: [], suitesRun, flakyRetried: [], reportPath, at}` to `{git-dir}/claude-tweaks-verify-pass.json`, keyed on the invoking cwd's own `git rev-parse HEAD` — never on `--git-dir` when one is supplied (see Red flags). `--stamp-status [--git-dir <dir>]` reads that artifact back and recomputes `dirty`/`head` fresh from the live tree rather than echoing the stored stamp, printing `{present, sha, head, dirty, scope, fullSha, match, verifiedHead, reportPath, legacy}` and always exiting 0 — status is data, never a failure, including when no stamp exists at all. A targeted run (`--no-stamp`, or a `--cmd` set that isn't the full resolved suite) must never leave a stale-but-plausible `scope: "full"` stamp behind for a later `--stamp-status` to misread as a clean full pass. `verifiedHead` (#1923) is the field the re-verify gates read — `true` for a clean HEAD covered by a full pass or by a passing scoped run whose `fullSha` is still an ancestor of HEAD — while `match` keeps its strict full-pass meaning.
- **Red flags:** A stamp written under a repo other than the one whose HEAD it claims — `--git-dir` on a run redirects `--log-dir`/`--count-stamp` paths only; it never writes the pass stamp, precisely because `gitInfo()` reads HEAD/dirty from the invoking cwd, not from `--git-dir`. `--stamp-status` reporting `match: true` against a dirty tree, or against a stamp whose `scope` isn't `full`.

### 8. Declare a scope, then watch three consecutive runs shrink to what changed
- **URL:** write `.claude-tweaks/verify-scope.json` (`checks.tests` as a map of suite name → command, `rules` as ordered `{match, suites, static}` globs — see `docs/plugin-structure.md`'s `plugin/bin/lib/verify/` row), then run `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/verify.js" --scope .claude-tweaks/verify-scope.json --integration-branch main --cmd types="tsc --noEmit" --cmd api="pnpm --filter api test" --cmd web="pnpm --filter web test"` three times: once fresh, once after a docs-only commit, once after an `apps/api/**` commit.
- **Action:** Read the `Scope:` line the runner prints above the results table on each run, then `{git-dir}/claude-tweaks-verify-pass.json` after each.
- **Should feel:** The runner, not the operator, decides how much to run — and says so in one line (`Scope: none — 1 changed file(s) since 3af174c00; suites: none; static: no; unmatched: 0`, then `still-verified: bookkeeping-only delta (docs/guide.md)`), so a shed suite is a stated decision with its evidence, never a quiet omission.
- **Should understand:** The first run has no prior stamp, so it is `full` and becomes the anchor (`fullSha`) every later run diffs from. A docs-only delta selects `none` — nothing spawns, the run exits 0, and the stamp is still written with `scope: "none"`, `base` equal to that anchor, and `suitesRun: []`. An `apps/api/**` delta selects `scoped` — only `api` (plus `types`/`lint` when the matching rule says `static: true`) runs, and the stamp carries the prior `fullSha` unchanged: only a `full` run may advance it, and only a `full` run rewrites the legacy bare-SHA twin or the #881 count stamp. A path no rule matches fails closed to `full` and is listed under `unmatched`. Every check the selected mode requires must be supplied as a `--cmd` (a `full` run needs every declared suite) — a missing one is exit 2 naming it, so a partial invocation can never stamp a pass. With no usable anchor, `--integration-branch` (or `--base`) is required — the runner has no `origin/HEAD` fallback; the caller runs `_shared/integration-branch.md`'s ladder, exactly as `blast-radius-cli.js` expects. A `checks.tests` string containing `{base}` switches to tool-scoped mode: the runner substitutes the resolved base into that one command and runs it as `tests`, and such a run never advances `fullSha` either. `report.json` gains a `scope` object (`suites` always an array) mirroring the stamp.
- **Red flags:** A `scoped` or `none` run whose stamp `fullSha` moved to the current HEAD; `--stamp-status` reading `match: true` off a `scope: "scoped"` stamp (it must not — only `full` matches); a `--scope` run at an unchanged HEAD replacing a `full` stamp with `none`; a `--cmd` name outside `types`/`lint`/the declared suites, or a `--base` that disagrees with the stamp anchor, exiting anything other than `2`; a renamed or non-ASCII path (`src/café.js`) appearing mangled in `changedFiles`; an unresolvable base producing an empty changed set instead of an error.

### 9. Ask the runner what changed, instead of hand-rolling git diff
- **URL:** `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/verify.js" --changed-files --integration-branch main` after Step 8's first (full) run, with one further commit and one uncommitted edit in the tree
- **Action:** Read the one JSON line it prints, then compare it with what `git diff --name-only` shows for the same tree.
- **Should feel:** One answer to "what changed in this run" — the same set `verify.js --scope` classifies, `/claude-tweaks:test affected` scopes tests to, and the pipeline's QA story filter selects `source_files` against — so the three consumers cannot disagree.
- **Should understand:** `{base, files}` — `base` is the stamp's `fullSha` when it is still an ancestor of HEAD (else the integration-branch merge-base, else the explicit `--base`), `files` is the committed delta since that base ∪ the working tree, untracked files included and renames reported at their new path. A bare `git diff --name-only` is empty for every committed pipeline diff, which is why `/claude-tweaks:test affected` and the `qa affected` filter were redefined onto this mode (#1923). It reads only — no report, no stamp, no log dir — and when no base resolves (no stamp, no `--integration-branch`, no `--base`) it exits 1 with a message rather than printing an empty list.
- **Red flags:** An empty `files` array on a tree with a committed change since the anchor; exit 0 with no output when the base could not be resolved; a `claude-tweaks-verify/` log dir or a stamp appearing after a `--changed-files` call; `--changed-files` accepted alongside `--cmd` or `--scope` (both are usage errors).

## Origin
- Created during build of #892 (deterministic verification runner + `verification.md` migration) — replaces the retired prose-orchestrated `LOG=`/`tail`/`grep` capture discipline `verification.md` Step 2 used to document directly.
- Step 6 added after #881 shipped (suite-count regression stamp) — the journey previously only forward-referenced it as "a future consumer of `report.json`'s `counts` field."
- Step 7 added, and Step 1's invocation lost its `--log-dir` substitution, after #1921 shipped (runner-written pass stamp, `--stamp-status`, runner-resolved default paths) — the runner is now the stamp's only writer, and `/test`/`/review` read it through `--stamp-status`.
- Step 8 added after #1922 shipped (diff-aware scoping engine: `--scope`/`--base`/`--integration-branch`, `verify-scope.json`, `declaration.js`/`changed-files.js`/`scope.js`) — the runner now decides how much of the declared suite set to run from the changed files since the last full pass, and the stamp's `scope` names exactly what ran.
- Step 9 added after #1923 shipped (`--changed-files` read-only mode; the re-verify scoping table in `test/verification.md`; `/claude-tweaks:test affected` and the pipeline QA story filter redefined onto the shared changed-file set) — the runner is now the one source of "what changed in this run".
- Related specs: #891 (parent — deterministic verification runner family), #881 (suite-count regression detection), #882 (flake adjudication — landed as a standalone `node --test` isolated re-run recipe in `verification.md`'s own "Flake adjudication" section; does not consume `verify.js`'s per-check log files)
