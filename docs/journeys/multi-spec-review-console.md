# Review and Approve a Multi-Spec /flow Run

**Persona:** claude-tweaks user who ran `/claude-tweaks:flow "#157,#159,#160"` (or similar, `auto`/`hybrid` mode) across several linked GitHub issues and now needs to review everything the pipeline auto-resolved or staged before it merges/finishes the shared branch.
**Goal:** Work through one consolidated batch table covering every spec in the run and make the terminal approve/override/stop decision — Approve all resolves every `Q#`/`M#`/`U#` proposal to its own stated default in the same click, with confidence that nothing any spec's pipeline decided was silently dropped from view.
**Entry point:** The last spec in the run reaches `/wrap-up`'s Phase 4 execution step (each spec's own per-spec Review Console was deferred via `MULTISPEC_REVIEW_DEFER=1`), triggering `/flow`'s consolidated Multi-Spec Review Console.
**Success state:** The batch decision is made (approved, or specific items overridden), every `Q#`/`M#`/`U#` proposal has a resolution — its own default under Approve all, or an explicit per-item answer under Override — the shared branch reaches an outcome (merged / PR / discarded), the parent run directory is archived, and the run's final turn closes with a plain-markdown `## Next Actions` block whose bold first line is the paste-ready next command.

## Steps

### 1. Read the consolidated batch tables — terminal
- **URL:** rendered automatically by `/flow` after the final spec's wrap-up; no command to run.
- **Action:** Read through the named batch sections in order — Auto-applied, Pending review, Low-confidence findings (if any spec's `/review` surfaced an unreproduced finding), Contested findings (if any spec had a cross-lens debate that didn't converge), then the five engine-fed sections (Skill/Documentation/Journey/Configuration updates, Reference repairs — inserted verbatim from `wrap-up-engine.js render --spec-state`), then Cleanup actions, Issue closures, Translated briefs, and the Queue writes / Memory updates / Upstream feedback sections.
- **Should feel:** Like reading one coherent report, not five specs' worth of disconnected logs stitched together — every row is `Spec`-tagged so it's traceable back to its origin without losing the batch view.
- **Should understand:** A row's number is part of one global sequence spanning every batch section (no restart between sections) — the numbers in the next step's override instructions refer to this sequence, not a per-section one. `Q#`/`M#`/`U#` sit outside that global sequence but are still part of the same terminal decision (see Step 3).
- **Red flags:** A row missing its `Spec` column; a section present in some spec's `decisions.md`/`staged/` but absent from the rendered table (the console's own Hard requirement forbids silently dropping any item); the five engine-fed sections showing a different table shape than a plain `| # | Spec | Target | Change | Disposition |` (that would mean the engine's output was hand-expanded instead of inserted verbatim); a staged proposal reported as dangling or missing when its judge wrote it into the worktree's shadow of the run dir — the batch pass's post-fan-out shadow sweep (`skills/wrap-up/curation-engine.md` §4, scoped per parent and per `spec-{N}/` run dir by `skills/flow/multispec-batch-curation.md`) should have relocated it and logged a `Shadow sweep:` line, so a dangling report means the sweep did not run.

### 2. Check the Cleanup actions rows before approving — terminal
- **URL:** the "Cleanup actions" section of the same rendered console.
- **Action:** Look at the numbered rows — one dev-server-teardown row and one branch-finish row with no `Spec` value, plus three rows per spec (claim release, grant removal, label cleanup) with a populated `Spec` value.
- **Should feel:** In control of teardown, not just informed about it after the fact — these rows are visible before they run and can be individually skipped in the next step, rather than executing unconditionally on batch approval.
- **Should understand:** The three per-spec rows depend on the branch-finish row completing first (claim release needs branch-finish's outcome — the merge commit sha or PR URL — to release each issue correctly); the dev-server-teardown row has no such dependency and can be skipped on its own.
- **Red flags:** A per-spec claim-release row with no visible branch-finish row above it in the same batch (the dependency would be invisible); the section missing entirely when a worktree strategy was used (it should always render for a multi-spec worktree run).

### 3. Answer the terminal batch decision — `AskUserQuestion`
- **URL:** the "How do you want to handle the Multi-Spec Review Console items?" prompt.
- **Action:** Choose Approve all, Override specific items (reply with `#`s to skip/modify/revert in the next message — free-text, not the tool's `Other` field), or Stop and re-engage.
- **Should feel:** Like one decision, not five — Approve all resolves the batch sections *and* every `Q#`/`M#`/`U#` proposal to its own stated default (`Apply` for `Q#`/`M#`, declined for `U#`) in the same click, with zero further prompts.
- **Should understand:** If the branch-finish row is skipped or reverted under Override, every per-spec claim-release/grant-removal/label-cleanup row auto-skips too (rendered "skipped — depends on branch-finish") rather than running against an outcome that never happened. Choosing Override is what still drills `Q#`/`M#`/`U#` individually (see Step 4) — Approve all never reaches that drill. Approving also applies every spec's staged review patches against the cumulative branch state per `skills/_shared/staged-patch.md`: a patch that still fits is `git apply`'d; one that went stale because a later spec, `/simplify`, or a fix wave moved its target is *expected* and is re-derived from the artifact's `Target:`/`Invariant:` preamble instead of erroring out — the log line names which path applied and what moved since `Staged-at:`.
- **Red flags:** Approve all silently skipping a `Q#`/`M#`/`U#` row instead of resolving it to its stated default; the console stopping on `git apply` "patch does not apply" / "No valid patches in input" for a staged review patch instead of falling back to its `Invariant:` (a malformed patch should have been rejected by `git apply --check` at staging time, never first seen here); a stale patch silently dropped with no "Not applied" footer row; a `U#` row ever resolving to filed under a human-answered Approve all (that's the `unattended`-only `consoleAutoResolve` exception, not this path).

### 4. Override: drill individual Queue writes / Memory updates / Upstream feedback — `AskUserQuestion`, one call per item
- **URL:** reached only after choosing Override in Step 3; one `AskUserQuestion` per `Q#`/`M#` row, issued individually, or one chunked `multiSelect` call per group of up to 4 `U#` rows.
- **Action:** For each, choose Apply, Skip, or Edit — read the full staged content shown below its row before deciding, since these create a new backlog work record, write a cross-project memory file, or file an issue against an upstream repo respectively.
- **Should feel:** Deliberate, never rushed into a bulk "yes to all" — each of these writes something that outlives this pipeline run, and reaching this step is itself the deliberate choice to inspect before deciding.
- **Should understand:** A memory write here degrades or improves every future session in every project; an upstream filing publishes privately-derived content to a public repo (already scrubbed, but still worth a real read before Apply).
- **Red flags:** Two `Q#`/`M#`/`U#` items ever being batched into one `AskUserQuestion` call — the pipeline's own contract forbids this regardless of how many are pending.

### 5. Read the closing Next Actions block — terminal
- **URL:** the final turn of the run, rendered after the console's decisions (and cleanup) resolve; no command to run.
- **Action:** Read the plain-markdown `Next Actions` block that closes the run — the bold first line is the actual next command for this run's outcome, paste-ready and fully qualified. A `/flow` run renders it as the Pipeline Summary's (or failure card's) own `### Next Actions` subsection; a standalone skill close-out uses top-level `## Next Actions` (docs/skill-authoring.md's Skill handoffs convention). Either heading level is correct here.
- **Should feel:** Never left composing the next command by hand — the run's last words tell you exactly what to run next, even when every approval above auto-resolved.
- **Should understand:** This block is a navigation affordance, not another approval gate — it renders in every mode including `unattended` (`consoleAutoResolve` never silences it, per `_shared/auto-mode-contract.md`'s not-silenced list). The one separate prompt that can legitimately appear beside this block is `flow/failure-cards.md`'s claims-release decision — a real blocking choice, rendered as its own call in whichever closing template applies (success summary or failure card), never folded into the block.
- **Red flags:** The run ending in bare prose with no `Next Actions` block at all (a rendering omission the contract now names); the block rendered as an `AskUserQuestion` menu instead of plain markdown.

## Origin
- Created during build of #287 ("Multi-spec console: engine-fed sections + prose parity") — the console existed before this build but had no journey coverage; #287 gave it its first Low-confidence findings/Contested findings sections and made Cleanup actions visible/overridable, both of which this journey documents as current behavior.
- Updated during build of #350 ("Review Console: fold M#/Q#/U# into Approve all and add the consoleAutoResolve path") — Steps 3-4 rewritten: Q#/M#/U# now resolve under the terminal Approve all / Override / Stop decision (their own stated default under Approve all; per-item drill only under Override), replacing the old always-separate-prompt behavior.
- Updated during build of #674 ("Review Console staged patches: validate at staging time and stage a normalization description, not a literal diff") — Step 3's "Should understand"/"Red flags" now cover the staged-patch apply path: `git apply --check` at staging, `Target:`/`Invariant:` preamble, description fallback for stale diffs at the console.
- Updated during build of #675 ("Curation-engine judges must verify their staged file landed at the anchored stagePath") — Step 1's red flags now name the dangling-staged-file symptom the post-fan-out shadow sweep exists to prevent.
- Updated during build of #716 ("auto-mode-contract: the closing Next Actions call is a navigation affordance, not silenced by consoleAutoResolve") — added Step 5: the contract now guarantees the run's closing plain-markdown `## Next Actions` block in every mode including `unattended`, recommended line = the actual next command.
- Related specs: #286 (Engine: multi-spec console section merging — the CLI call Step 1 references), #287, #350, #674, #675, #716
