# Finish a `local-merge` Run Without a Human

**Persona:** Maintainer of a no-forge (`local-merge`) project running `/claude-tweaks:flow` in `auto`, `confirm`, or `hybrid` mode who isn't present when the run reaches its branch-finish step.
**Goal:** The run's feature branch merges itself (or parks cleanly) without ever blocking on `/superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`'s interactive menu — the same hands-off guarantee `pr-first` runs already have via `_shared/pr-first-merge.md`.
**Entry point:** `/claude-tweaks:wrap-up`'s Phase 4 execution step, Section C (`cleanup-procedures-execution.md`), the `integration-model: local-merge` branch, once the feature branch's finish decision is "not yet decided."
**Success state:** The branch is merged into the integration branch and pushed, with the outcome logged to `decisions.md` — or, if the merge genuinely can't complete cleanly, the run parks with the worktree and branch preserved and a clear log entry explaining why, ready for a human to pick up later.

## Steps

### 1. Reach Section C with the branch not yet finished
- **URL:** none — this happens inside `/claude-tweaks:wrap-up`'s Phase 4 execution step, unattended
- **Action:** The pipeline reaches the worktree/branch-finish cleanup item having neither merged, opened a PR, nor discarded the feature branch yet.
- **Should feel:** Invisible — nothing prompts the maintainer.
- **Should understand:** This step checks `_shared/local-merge-auto-finish.md`'s Precondition first (`integration-model` resolves `local-merge` AND this run's `config.yml` exists) before deciding whether to route through the no-prompt path or the original interactive skill.
- **Red flags:** An interactive `AskUserQuestion`-shaped menu appearing here for a run whose `config.yml` exists — that would mean the precondition check was skipped.

### 2a. The branch merges itself — terminal, no interaction
- **URL:** none — `_shared/local-merge-auto-finish.md`'s Procedure runs from inside the worktree/main checkout
- **Action:** The default policy (merge locally) resolves the integration branch, merges the feature branch with `--no-ff`, runs verification on the merged result, and — on green — pushes and logs the `merged` outcome.
- **Should feel:** Invisible — the maintainer notices only that the branch is already merged when they check back.
- **Should understand:** Discard and keep-as-is are never chosen automatically — merging locally is the only default this path can produce, matching `finishing-a-development-branch`'s own rule that discard requires an explicit human ask.
- **Red flags:** A merge commit with no corresponding `AUTO … [outcome: merged]` line in `decisions.md`.

### 2b. The merge can't complete cleanly — parks instead
- **URL:** none — the Park branch inside `_shared/local-merge-auto-finish.md`'s Procedure
- **Action:** A genuine merge conflict, or a failed verification run against the merged result, aborts/reverts the attempt and logs an `AUTO … [outcome: pending-review]` line. The worktree, branch, and issue claim are left exactly as they were.
- **Should feel:** A clear stop, not a silent failure — the next session picking this up sees precisely why it parked.
- **Should understand:** This is the one decision `_shared/auto-mode-contract.md` reserves for a human — conflict resolution is never attempted automatically, regardless of mode.
- **Red flags:** A worktree left half-merged, or a park with no log entry naming the reason.

### 3. Interactive mode is unaffected
- **URL:** `/superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`'s own menu, reached only when `local-merge-auto-finish.md`'s Precondition fails
- **Action:** A standalone or `interactive`-mode run (no `config.yml` in its run directory) still gets the original interactive menu and waits for an answer, exactly as before this journey's underlying behavior existed.
- **Should feel:** No change from prior behavior for anyone who runs the pipeline interactively.
- **Should understand:** The presence of `config.yml` is the same "not `interactive`" signal `wrap-up/SKILL.md`'s `ceremony-profile` read already uses — no new mode-detection mechanism was introduced.
- **Red flags:** An interactive run's menu being silently skipped — that would mean the precondition check inverted.

## Origin
- Created during build of #771 (local-merge + auto mode: finishing-a-development-branch has no auto-mode awareness, blocks on a human answer)
- Related: #688, #689, #693 (the `pr-first` sibling behavior this journey mirrors)
