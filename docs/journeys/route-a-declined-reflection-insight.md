# Route a Declined Reflection Insight

**Persona:** A claude-tweaks maintainer running `/claude-tweaks:wrap-up` at the end of a build who has seen essentially this same reflect insight before — a prior run's "don't capture" call they still stand by — and doesn't want to re-litigate it every single time.
**Goal:** See the batch table flag which insights are re-surfacing a prior decline, with the stated reason from that decline, so the "don't capture" call from before is a one-glance confirmation rather than a fresh judgment call — while staying free to capture it this time if circumstances have actually changed.
**Entry point:** `/claude-tweaks:wrap-up` (or standalone `/claude-tweaks:reflect`) reaching Step 3's interactive-mode batch routing, `### Reflection Insights` table about to render.
**Success state:** Every insight in the table has an explicit routing decision; a re-surfacing insight the maintainer already declined once carries a visible "(previously declined {date}: {reason})" annotation in its row, and the maintainer's decision on it — reaffirm the decline, or capture it after all — is recorded so the next run's table reflects the current state, not a stale one.

## Steps

### 1. Insights are fingerprinted and checked against prior declines — before the table renders
- **URL:** same session, immediately before the `### Reflection Insights` table
- **Action:** For each insight the five lenses (plus the tradeoff review) produced, `full-mode.md`'s Prior-decline annotation step computes a fingerprint from the insight's own description text (`createFingerprint('reflect', ['description'])`, `bin/lib/health-core/fingerprint.js`) and looks it up in the declined-learning store (`lookupDecline(fingerprint)`, `bin/lib/declined-learning/store.js`).
- **Should feel:** Invisible when there's no history — a first-time insight renders exactly as it always has, no extra clause, no delay.
- **Should understand:** Nothing is filtered or hidden at this step — every insight still gets a full table row and a real recommendation, matched or not. The lookup only decides whether to append an annotation, never whether to include the row at all.
- **Red flags:** A previously-declined insight silently dropped from the table instead of rendered with its annotation; the lookup running against live text instead of the frozen description that was actually declined, producing a match that shouldn't exist.

### 2. The batch table renders with the annotation visible
- **URL:** same session, `### Reflection Insights` table
- **Action:** The maintainer reads the table. A matched insight's cell reads `{insight text} _(previously declined {declinedAt date}: {reason})_` — the exact reason recorded when it was declined, not a generic "seen before" marker.
- **Should feel:** Like being handed the earlier judgment call back, not asked to re-derive it — the annotation is a memory aid, not friction.
- **Should understand:** The annotation is advisory. The recommendation column still shows a real, independent call (Implement now / Defer / Capture / Digest / Don't capture) — the maintainer is free to disagree with the earlier decline and capture the insight this time, especially if the annotation's reason no longer applies. "Digest — below floor" is a real recommendation like any other, not a refusal to judge: an insight that misses `_shared/materiality-floor.md`'s floor with a non-`tangential` `Defer-reason:` is routed to the rolling digest container instead of a new record, and the digest entry is written only once the row is approved.
- **Red flags:** An annotation with a missing or generic reason (the stored `reason` should be the actual free-text the maintainer gave, per the "Don't capture" step's "must state why" rule); an annotation on an insight whose text only superficially resembles the declined one but means something materially different.

### 3. Resolve the batch — reaffirm the decline, or capture it after all
- **URL:** same session, immediately after `AskUserQuestion`'s "Apply all" / "Override specific items" answer
- **Action:** For each annotated insight: if it resolves to "Don't capture" again, the decline is (re-)recorded via `recordDecline(fingerprint, { reason, source: 'wrap-up' })` — same fingerprint, fresh `declinedAt`/`reason`. If it resolves to anything else (Implement now, Defer, Capture — the maintainer decided the earlier "don't capture" no longer holds), the stale entry is cleared via `clearDecline(fingerprint)` so this insight text doesn't stay annotated once it's been acted on.
- **Should feel:** Like the system is tracking the maintainer's own standing decisions, not overriding them — reaffirming costs nothing extra, and reversing is a first-class outcome, not a workaround.
- **Should understand:** A decline-write failure degrades open (logged, batch resolution proceeds) — losing the annotation on a future run is a minor inconvenience, never a reason this step blocks.
- **Red flags:** A re-declined insight's `declinedAt`/`reason` not updating (stale timestamp implies the store isn't actually being re-written); a captured insight's annotation still showing up on the very next run because `clearDecline` wasn't called.

## Origin
- Created during build of #849 (declined-learning fingerprint store shared by `/feedback` session evaluation and `/wrap-up` curation)
- Related journeys: `file-upstream-feedback-in-batch` (the analogous decline-tracking behavior on the `/feedback` side of the same store)
