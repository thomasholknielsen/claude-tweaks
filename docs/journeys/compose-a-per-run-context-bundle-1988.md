# Compose a Per-Run Context Bundle From Fenced Skill Sources

**Persona:** claude-tweaks skill author about to fence a `_shared/*.md` contract with `<!-- when: key=value -->` markers for the first time, who wants to see — before touching a real file — exactly what a step reads back, what happens to a branch the run didn't take, what happens to a key the run can't resolve, and what a broken marker does to a bundle that already exists.
**Goal:** Run `plugin/bin/compose-context.js` against a scratch run directory and two scratch sources, and read the composed bundle, the JSON envelope, and each exit code with their own eyes.
**Entry point:** A terminal at this repo's checkout root, `plugin/bin/compose-context.js` reachable (this repo's own checkout, or another project's resolved plugin root per `docs/skill-authoring.md`'s plugin-root contract), and a scratch directory under the OS temp dir standing in for a run directory.
**Success state:** One bundle at `{run}/context/{step}.md` whose first line names every key's resolved value, whose body carries only the branches the run took, and a stdout JSON line that tells the calling step where the bundle is and which keys kept both branches — plus a clear picture of when the step must fall back to reading the sources directly.

## Steps

### 1. Compose two fenced sources against a pinned run — terminal
- **URL:** `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/compose-context.js" --run /tmp/compose-demo --step merge /tmp/compose-demo/a.md /tmp/compose-demo/b.md`, after `mkdir -p /tmp/compose-demo`, writing `/tmp/compose-demo/config.yml` as `mode: auto` + `integration-model: pr-first`, and `a.md` as a `# A` heading followed by a `<!-- when: integration-model=pr-first -->` block and a `<!-- when: integration-model=local-merge -->` block (each on its own lines, closed by `<!-- /when -->`), `b.md` as plain prose.
- **Action:** Run it, then `cat /tmp/compose-demo/context/merge.md`.
- **Should feel:** One command, one file to read — the step never opens `a.md` or `b.md` itself.
- **Should understand:** The bundle opens with `<!-- resolved: integration-model=pr-first mode=auto attendance=… transport=… worktree-policy=… work-backend=… -->` in that fixed six-key order, then `a.md`'s kept lines (the `pr-first` branch, marker lines stripped, the `local-merge` branch gone) and then `b.md`, in argv order. stdout is exactly one JSON line: `{"path": …, "bytes": …, "sources": [the two argv strings verbatim], "unresolved": [...]}`. The bundle is regenerated on every call — edit `config.yml` to `integration-model: local-merge`, re-run, and the other branch appears; nothing is cached.
- **Red flags:** Both branches present with the key pinned; marker lines surviving into the body; sources out of argv order; more than one line on stdout; a bundle that does not change after the pin changes.

### 2. Read which keys kept both branches
- **URL:** the same command with `config.yml` deleted, against a scratch dir that has no `.claude-tweaks/policy.yml` and no `CLAUDE.md`
- **Action:** Re-run Step 1's command and read the header line and the JSON's `unresolved` array.
- **Should feel:** Honest — the composer says which keys it could not resolve instead of guessing.
- **Should understand:** `integration-model`, `mode`, `attendance`, `worktree-policy`, and `work-backend` all read `unresolved`, and both of `a.md`'s blocks are now in the bundle: an unresolved key never drops a branch. `transport` still resolves (`gh` or `mcp`) — it is a probe for the `gh` binary, never a guess. `integration-model` resolves only from the run's `config.yml` pin (every `/flow` run writes one at the Manifesto) or `policy.yml`; the composer never runs forge detection, because detection fails open to `local-merge` indistinguishably from a real answer and would silently drop every `pr-first` branch.
- **Red flags:** A key resolved to a default value the run never set; a branch missing while its key reads `unresolved`; a `gh repo view` or `git remote` call showing up in a trace (the module's only shell-out is `gh --version`).

### 3. Break a marker and watch the prior bundle survive
- **URL:** the same command with a third source `bad.md` containing `<!-- when: mode=auto -->` and no closing marker
- **Action:** Run Step 1's command once more with `bad.md` appended, then read stderr, the exit code, and `context/merge.md` again.
- **Should feel:** Loud, precise, and safe — the failure names the file and line, and the good bundle from the previous call is byte-for-byte untouched.
- **Should understand:** Exit `2`, stderr `compose-context.js: /tmp/compose-demo/bad.md:1: unclosed marker …`, nothing on stdout, nothing written, no temp file left in `context/`. Every marker in every source is validated before a single byte is written, so a failing call is a no-op on disk. The same exit `2` covers a malformed invocation (usage on stderr), an unknown key or value, nesting deeper than one level, a close with no open, and a `--run` directory that is missing or resolves inside a checkout other than the main one; exit `1` is a filesystem failure (an unreadable source, an unwritable output path). This is why the call-site guidance in `docs/skill-authoring.md` says the step checks the exit code before reading the bundle: a stale bundle from an earlier composition is still sitting there, and the fallback on any non-zero exit is to read the named sources directly.
- **Red flags:** A partially written or emptied `merge.md` after the failure; an exit code other than 2 for a bad marker; a `merge.md.tmp-*` file left behind; a step that reads the bundle without checking the exit code.

### 4. Document the grammar inside a fenced code block
- **URL:** the same command with `a.md` extended by a ```` ```markdown ```` fenced block that quotes a full `<!-- when: … --> … <!-- /when -->` example
- **Action:** Re-run and read the bundle.
- **Should feel:** Unsurprising — the example is prose, and it comes through as prose.
- **Should understand:** Lines inside a fenced code block are literal text to the composer: never markers, never validated, never stripped. A fence closes only on a fence of the same character (backtick or tilde) with at least the opener's length, so a three-backtick example nested inside a four-backtick fence stays inside it. This is how a `_shared/*.md` file documents the marker grammar without triggering it.
- **Red flags:** The fenced example's marker lines stripped or its inner branch dropped; a spurious "close without open" error caused by a nested fence of a different character.

### 5. Trigger the run-dir guard
- **URL:** `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/compose-context.js" --run .claude/worktrees/some-worktree/.claude-tweaks/pipelines/some-run --step x a.md` from inside a checkout
- **Action:** Point `--run` at a run directory that resolves inside a linked worktree instead of the main checkout.
- **Should feel:** Refused before anything happens — the same `[IL-127]` posture every other run-directory CLI in this plugin takes.
- **Should understand:** Exit `2` with a message naming the main checkout the path resolves outside of, nothing written. A path outside any checkout at all (this journey's `/tmp/compose-demo`) is accepted as-is — the anchored-or-outside rule `resolve-policy.js` and `resolve-profile.js` carry, registered for this CLI in `plugin/skills/_shared/pipeline-run-dir.md`'s CLI-argument-boundary section.
- **Red flags:** A bundle written into a worktree-local shadow run dir; a temp-dir run dir refused.

### 6. Compose the real merge bundle the way `/wrap-up` does — terminal
- **URL:** `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/compose-context.js" --run /tmp/compose-demo --step merge "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/pr-first-merge.md" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/pr-early-run-lifecycle.md"`, with `config.yml` restored to `integration-model: pr-first` and `gh` on PATH — the exact call `plugin/skills/wrap-up/auto-merge-short-circuit.md` and `review-console.md`'s "Approve all + merge" step carry.
- **Action:** Run it, read the JSON line's `bytes`, then open `context/merge.md` and search it for `Local-merge fallback` and `Scope extends to issue reads`.
- **Should feel:** The first production use of the composer, and nothing changed in how the procedure reads — only what is absent.
- **Should understand:** The `## Local-merge fallback` heading is still there but its body is gone (a fenced-whole section renders as a bare heading in the untaken composition — the heading marks the branch's place, so any citation to it by name still resolves); the `## Skip / degrade behavior` section keeps its degrade table (rows 2-7 are pr-first paths) and loses only the local-merge paragraph and its SKIP block; the MCP root-cause section keeps its `Confirmed against…` bullets and `**Consequence:**` paragraph (three later sentences cite "Root cause above" under every transport) and loses only the `**Scope extends…**` paragraph. Source paths are `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`-rooted, never repo-relative — a `plugin/skills/…` path resolves only from a claude-tweaks checkout and would exit 1 in every consumer install. The bundle is ~56 KB against ~59 KB for the two raw files: additive fencing of prose that already exists is a small saving; the per-step byte budget is #1990's job. `stripMarkers(source) === git show origin/main:{source}` holds for both files — the migration inserted marker lines and changed nothing else.
- **Red flags:** A `Local-merge fallback` body present under `pr-first`; a degrade-table row missing; a "Root cause above" citation with no root cause left in the bundle; exit 1 with an ENOENT naming `plugin/skills/…`; a skill step that reads `context/merge.md` without checking the exit code first.

### 7. Compose the Manifesto bundle for the mode a run resolved — terminal
- **URL:** `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/compose-context.js" --run /tmp/compose-demo --step manifesto "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/flow/manifesto.md"`, with `config.yml` reading `mode: auto` — the call `plugin/skills/flow/SKILL.md`'s Step 3 carries.
- **Action:** Run it, grep `context/manifesto.md` for `**`confirm` mode**`; change `config.yml` to `mode: confirm`, re-run, grep for `render the FYI variant instead`; delete `config.yml`, re-run, and read the JSON line's `unresolved`.
- **Should feel:** The Manifesto a run reads describes only the stop it will actually make.
- **Should understand:** Under `auto` the `hybrid` and `interactive` bullets are gone; the `confirm` bullet stays — it's unconditional now that the `hybrid` bullet cites it ("same as `confirm`"). Under `confirm` the `auto` bullet, the FYI-rendering paragraph, and the `interactive` bullet are gone. With no `config.yml`, `mode` and `attendance` are `unresolved`, both branches are present, and the bundle is what a standalone run pays — the same text as reading the file directly. Four fences carry everything that is single-mode in this file (`auto`, `hybrid`, `interactive`, the FYI paragraph); the `confirm` bullet stays unconditional because the `hybrid` bullet cites it, and passages true under `confirm` *or* `hybrid` stay unconditional too, since the grammar has no OR — the shared template and Path conventions are cited by other files and never fenced. The `interactive` fence still strips 474 B from every bundle a real run composes even though an `interactive` run never reaches Step 3 to read this file at all. This is a small saving on purpose: the surveys behind #1991 found the flow lifecycle's big shared contracts (`pipeline-run-dir.md`, `auto-mode-contract.md`) branch on `integration-model`, `worktree-policy`, and `transport`, not on `mode` — a bundle of those two would be ~70 KB under every mode and the composed-bytes gate would reject it, so no `flow-run` call site exists.
- **Red flags:** A `confirm` bullet missing under `mode: auto`; a `hybrid` or `interactive` bullet present under `mode: auto`; the `auto` bullet or the FYI paragraph present under `mode: confirm`; a bundle that differs from the raw file with no `config.yml`; a `flow-run` step in `composedBytesReport`'s table.

### 8. Compose the claim procedure a cloud Routine reads without `gh` — terminal
- **URL:** `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/compose-context.js" --run /tmp/compose-demo --step claims "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/issue-claims.md"`, once with `gh` on PATH and once as `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin node …` (a PATH with no `gh`) — the call `plugin/skills/tidy/scan-procedures.md` Step 4.7 and `plugin/skills/flow/claim-targets.md`'s MCP path carry.
- **Action:** Run both, read each bundle's first line, and grep `context/claims.md` for `create_or_update_file` and for `gh api --method PUT`.
- **Should feel:** The transport was decided by the machine, not by a config file — `transport` is a probe for the `gh` binary and never reads `unresolved`.
- **Should understand:** With `gh` present the header says `transport=gh`, the paired `- **gh CLI:**` bullets under "The lock" are present and the `- **MCP:**` bullets and the MCP list-all-claims bullet are gone; without `gh` the header says `transport=mcp` and the reverse holds — the bundle a cloud Routine reads is the procedure it can actually run. The manual repair steps stay in both, because the unconditional CLI paragraph above them says "steps 1-4 below": a fence may only hide prose that nothing outside the fence points the reader at (`docs/skill-authoring.md`'s every-citation-resolves rule — the whole-branch review caught four pointers that broke it). The same shape gives `tidy` Step 4.8 a `pr-scan` bundle from `github-pr-scan.md` in which an MCP run drops the two PR-backed procedure bodies whose labels nothing cites by number into the fence (item 9's body, `triage-queue` item 3 with its unconditional "omit the line" instruction), while `repo-wide` items 1, 2, and 4 and the `current-pr` items stay — they are cited by number, or pointed at from another item — and degrade per the Transport section. Neither bundle joins the other: three files of claim and scan prose total 118 KB, and the composed-bytes gate rejects any call site over 40 KB — each source composes alone, at 37 KB and 40 KB. `github-pr-scan-acceptance.md` has no transport branch at all (its scopes hard-skip without `gh`) and stays a raw read.
- **Red flags:** `transport=unresolved` in any header; a `- **MCP:**` bullet present under `gh` or a `gh api --method PUT` line under `mcp`; item 9's label, `repo-wide` item 4, or the `- **PR-backed items**` bullet missing under either transport (cited by number or by "see Transport above"); the repair steps missing under `gh` ("steps 1-4 below" promises them); a `claims-scan` step in `composedBytesReport`'s table; a compose sentence in `dispatch/SKILL.md` (it does not claim, and sits 12 B under its raw gate).

### 9. Compose a bundle that has nothing to strip — terminal
- **URL:** `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/compose-context.js" --run "$PIPELINE_RUN_DIR" --step worktree-setup "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/worktree-setup.md" "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/build/worktree-setup.md"` — `build/SKILL.md` Common Step 1's read since #1993.
- **Action:** Run it under any policy, read the header line, and `wc -c` the bundle against the two sources.
- **Should feel:** Nothing was decided. The header still names every resolved condition, but the bundle is the two files end to end, because neither file carries a line that branches on `worktree-policy`.
- **Should understand:** The record that added this call site assumed the files held always-vs-optional prose; a plan-time survey measured 0 B on both, so no markers were added and the switch ships on its other rationale — one read of one bundle instead of a read of the build file plus section-by-section reads of the shared contract. What that costs: the bundle is ~36.8 KB against a 40,960 B composed ceiling, so the two files' growth budgets are now coupled at this call site, and `context-cost.test.js`'s composed gate is what says so first. A zero-fence bundle is the composer working as designed, not a failure of it — but it buys only the read-once shape, and can cost ~3.5 KB of shared prose the old path could skip (the shared file's Resolving, Pre-creation reconcile, and Anti-patterns sections, which the build addendum never cites by name).
- **Red flags:** any `when:` marker in either source (the survey said none belongs); a header naming `worktree-policy=unresolved` on a project whose `policy.yml` sets `worktree-always` (the resolver reads that key); a composed-gate failure at this call site after an unrelated edit to either file; a compose attempt with `$PIPELINE_RUN_DIR` unset — it would exit 2 on every run and the fallback would mask it, which is why the call site gates on the variable being set (a `/flow` parent exports it; a standalone `/build` usually has none yet, since record mode mints its directory at Spec Step 1's materialize and design mode never does, though a most-recent-matching directory or the inline-export resume form can legitimately supply one).

### 10. Hand a dispatched agent the bundle, not the contract — terminal
- **URL:** `plugin/skills/dispatch/task-prompt.md`, Context pack item 5, and the second-call template's four bundle citations — after `/claude-tweaks:dispatch` has minted a group's run directory.
- **Action:** Compose `claims` and `merge` into `{minted-run-dir}/context/` as item 5 says, then read the second-call template as the dispatched agent would: every claim-state or merge-outcome citation names `{minted-run-dir}/context/claims.md` or `merge.md`, with "if that bundle is absent, read `_shared/…` directly" in the same sentence.
- **Should feel:** The agent is never sent to a `_shared/` file to discover which branch applies — the dispatcher already resolved that and left the answer in the run directory; the two `_shared/` names that remain in the template (`pipeline-run-dir.md`, `integration-model.md`) are the documented gaps, not oversights.
- **Should understand:** The clean room is the contract's founding premise: an agent only sees its prompt, so a prompt citing `_shared/pr-first-merge.md` sends it to read both integration models, and a prompt citing the composed `merge.md` sends it to the one it is running under. The compose command's own fallback ("if the compose command is unavailable or exits non-zero, read the named source files directly") belongs to whoever runs the command — the dispatcher — so the agent's fallback is phrased for what the agent can observe: the bundle file being absent. `tests/dispatch-prompt-bundle-citations.test.js` pins every fenced template `_shared/`-free except those two shapes and the named gaps, and fails if a listed gap disappears, so the list cannot rot. The lens prompts in `review/step3-lens-dispatch.md` were already clean — their fenced block is byte-pinned to the calibration fragment and carries no path at all.
- **Red flags:** a `_shared/` path inside a fenced template without a fallback shape or a gap entry; a compose line in the Context pack that still reads `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` instead of the substituted `{plugin-root}` literal (the agent's shell cannot expand it); `_shared/subagent-output-contract.md` within a sentence of its 40,960 B raw gate again (it sat at 252 B before #1995 extracted `_shared/dispatch-waiting.md`).

## Origin
- Created during build of #1988 (per-run skill-context composer CLI — Phase 1 of #1987's decomposition); steps 1-5 built in this session.
- Step 6 added during build of #1989 (merge-path markers — the first production consumer: `pr-first-merge.md` and `pr-early-run-lifecycle.md` fenced, `/wrap-up`'s two merge sites reading the composed `merge` bundle).
- Step 7 added during build of #1991 (mode markers on `manifesto.md`; `flow/SKILL.md`'s Step 3 reads the composed `manifesto` bundle; the other three named sources measured as carrying no prose on this axis).
- Step 8 added during build of #1992 (transport markers on `issue-claims.md` and `github-pr-scan.md`; the single-source `claims` and `pr-scan` bundles at tidy's claim sweep and PR scan and flow's MCP claim path; the transport probe exercised with `gh` removed from PATH).
- Step 9 added during build of #1993 (the `worktree-setup` bundle at `build/SKILL.md` Common Step 1 — a two-source bundle with zero fences, after a survey found no worktree-policy prose in either file).
- Step 10 added during build of #1995 (dispatch task prompts cite the `claims` and `merge` bundles the dispatcher composes before dispatch; the contract's cite-the-bundle rule; `_shared/dispatch-waiting.md` extracted for headroom).
- Related specs: #1987 (parent design), #1990 (composed-bytes measurement, imports `stripMarkers`/`compose`; carries the merge bundle's byte budget), #1991-#1994 (the remaining records that fence real `_shared/*.md` files), #1995-#1997.
