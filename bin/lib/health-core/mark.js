//
// The 'declined' mark is always written to the local gitignored cache (the
// pre-existing behavior — every caller must keep working unmodified with no
// other params supplied). Two capabilities are additive and OPTIONAL,
// activated only when the caller supplies them:
//   - `updateCache` (from health-core/cache.js's createCache): if supplied,
//     the local write goes through an atomic read-modify-write instead of a
//     bare readCache-then-writeCache pair, closing the race where two
//     near-simultaneous `mark` invocations against the same cache.json
//     silently clobber one another.
//   - `readDurableState`/`writeDurableState` (from a skill's own cache.js,
//     wrapping health-core/durable-state.js's createDurableState with
//     includeDeclined: true): if BOTH are supplied, the declined mark is
//     ALSO persisted to the health-state git branch — durable across a
//     scheduled Routine firing's fresh, stateless container, unlike the
//     local cache, which does not survive that. Without this, a 'declined'
//     finding (by definition never filed as a GitHub issue, so nothing for
//     dedup to reconstruct from) would silently reappear on the next
//     Routine firing despite the skill's own documented "suppressed
//     forever" promise.

// (if anything) is already in the local cache for that fingerprint,
// matching each skill's own dedup.js decide()'s precedence (its optional
// durableDeclined-equivalent argument is checked before the local-cache

// Pure: folds the fingerprints a run suppressed because their matching GitHub
// issue carried the `wontfix` label into the durable `declined` slice, so the
// suppression survives a later firing that cannot rebuild the issue index at
// all (`gh` absent AND no MCP transport, or GitHub unreachable outright). The
// local gitignored cache is not a substitute: it does not survive a scheduled
// Routine firing's fresh container, which is precisely the environment these
// skills run in unattended.
//
// Shared by all three health builders (harness/journey/docs
// buildValidateFindingsUpdate) rather than triplicated in each, so the entry
// shape and the first-write-wins rule below are defined once.
//
// First write wins: an existing entry is never overwritten. A human `mark
// ... declined` and a label-derived suppression both mean "never re-propose
// this," so clobbering would only churn `lastSeenMs` and lose the original
// provenance — and the human mark is the stronger statement of the two.
//
// `origin` records which path created the entry. Entries written by `mark`
// carry no `origin` (pre-existing shape, left untouched for compatibility);
// only label-derived ones are tagged, so provenance is readable off the
// health-state branch without a schema migration. mergeDeclinedIntoCache
// reads only `lastSeenMs`, so the extra key is inert to every consumer.
