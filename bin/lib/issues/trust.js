// --- Operational outcome evidence (merged-and-unreverted) -----------------

// merged and unreverted for at least `trust-revert-window-days` (default 14).
// Evaluated lazily at read time from record state + an injected git log — no
// scheduled job, no cached verdict file. An undiscoverable close stays
// unknown — never defaults to known-good or known-bad. That is the coverage
// boundary this module states about itself: a manual revert naming neither a
// `This reverts commit <sha>` trailer nor the record number is an
// out-of-scope false negative.
//
// A *discovered* revert is negative evidence (#268), not merely
// not-countable: it converts what would have been known-good into a
// known-bad outcome for the record's class, on the same lazy read — there is
// no stored verdict to invalidate, since nothing here is ever cached.
//
// Route 1 (a GitHub timeline `closed` event's commit reference) needs a
// per-issue GitHub API call this module cannot make itself — it is pure, no
// network. A caller that resolves it attaches the SHA(s) to the record as
// `closingCommitShas` before calling trustRows; discovery below prefers that
// signal outright when present. Route 2 (a commit-message scan for
// `(refs|closes|fixes) #N`, word-bounded) is load-bearing for this repo: its
