# Parse-Signal Discipline — Distinguish "Couldn't Parse" From "Doesn't Apply"

A deterministic check that mechanizes a hand-run prose heuristic — grepping a plan for a
verification command, reading a record body for a metadata line, scanning free-form config for a
keyword — is not parsing a formal grammar. Real inputs vary in ways the check's author didn't
anticipate. When the check hits an input it cannot confidently parse, that outcome must be
distinguishable from "this input legitimately does not need this check" — collapsing both into one
`null`/skip return turns an unparseable input into a silent false negative: the check reports
nothing, and nothing downstream ever learns the check didn't actually run.

## The anti-pattern

A function returns the same falsy value (`null`, `undefined`, `[]`, `false`) for two genuinely
different situations:

1. **Doesn't apply.** The input correctly has nothing for this check to find — e.g. a task with no
   Step 2 sub-step at all.
2. **Couldn't parse.** The input has the shape the check is looking for, but malformed or
   incomplete — e.g. a Step 2 heading present, but with no matching `Run:`/`Expected:` pair
   underneath it.

A caller that only ever sees the merged falsy value cannot tell these apart, so it always takes the
"doesn't apply" branch — even when the real story is "this input needed checking and the checker
gave up silently."

## Worked example: `extractStep2Verification`

`plugin/bin/lib/plan-audit/parser.js`'s `extractStep2Verification` (from #903's
`plan-audit.js` Check C) is the concrete case this rule generalizes from — surfaced during #903's
own review/hindsight pass as ledger item 19, building on
ledger item 18's finding about the same function. Its own code comment states the collapse
explicitly:

> Returns null when the task carries no Step 2 (or no Run:/Expected: pair under it) — a non-code
> task, per plan-audit.md's Check C.

Both "no Step 2 at all" (doesn't apply — a documentation-only task has no verification command to
check) and "Step 2 exists but has no parseable Run:/Expected: pair" (couldn't parse — a malformed
task that *should* have a verification command) return the identical `null`. Check C's caller
(`extractVerificationChecks`) filters on that `null` and moves on either way, so a task whose
Step 2 was simply malformed silently drops out of Check C's audit with no warning — exactly a false
negative, not a caught gap.

(Note: the record that requested this skill named the function `parseStep2`, which does not exist
anywhere in this repo — the real name is `extractStep2Verification`. This citation uses the
verified name; treat any reference to `parseStep2` elsewhere as the same stale-name drift.)

## The fix shape

When mechanizing a prose heuristic into a deterministic check:

1. **Give "couldn't parse" its own return shape**, distinguishable at the type level from "doesn't
   apply" — e.g. a tagged result (`{status: 'not-applicable'} | {status: 'unparseable', reason}
   | {status: 'ok', value}`), a sentinel distinct from your "doesn't apply" value, or a thrown/
   caught error the caller handles separately. Never reuse the same `null`/`undefined`/`[]` for
   both.
2. **Surface the unparseable case as a warning**, not a silent skip — the caller (or the check's own
   output) should name which input it could not confidently parse, so a human or a later pass can
   look at it, rather than the input silently vanishing from the audit's results.
3. **Reserve the merged-falsy shortcut for genuine non-applicability only** — it's fine for a check
   to return one clean "nothing here" value when the input plainly doesn't have the shape the check
   looks for at all (e.g. no Step 2 heading whatsoever). The risk is specifically when the input
   has *some* of the expected shape but not enough to parse confidently — that's the case that
   needs its own signal.

## When to use

- Writing a new function that parses a plan, a record body, a ledger entry, or any other loose
  prose artifact in this repo into a structured result for a deterministic (non-LLM) check to act
  on.
- Reviewing an existing parser of this kind and checking whether its "nothing found" return path
  actually merges two different situations.

## When not to use

- The input is validated against a real grammar or schema (JSON, YAML frontmatter with a fixed key
  set) where a parse failure is already a hard error, not a silent skip — this rule targets loose
  prose heuristics specifically, not formal-grammar parsing.
- The check truly has only one kind of "not found" — no plausible reason for a caller to need to
  tell "doesn't apply" apart from "couldn't parse" for this particular input shape.

## Origin

Filed as record #1595 from `/claude-tweaks:reflect` hindsight mode during #903's review (ledger
item 19), generalizing ledger item 18's finding about `plan-audit.js` Check C's
`extractStep2Verification`.
