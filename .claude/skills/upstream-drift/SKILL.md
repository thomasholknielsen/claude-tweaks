# Upstream Drift — What Broke, and What Arrived

A project-local audit of this repo's upstream dependencies: reports contract **drift** from the deterministic checks, then judges **capability** — upstream surface that is new and unclaimed — by diffing the dependency's contract subtree between the installed tag and the latest. Never edits anything, including the dependencies themselves.

```
tools/upstream-drift/manifest.yml
        |
        +-- checks.js (deterministic) ------> drift findings ----+
        |     version / assertions / fixtures                     |
        |                                                          +--> report
        +-- upstream tree @ installed vs latest --> JUDGE ------->+
              judge-procedure.md                capability findings
```

**Lifecycle:** utility, no fixed position. Runs standalone, or on a schedule via `tools/upstream-drift/run.js` — the runner decides which dependencies are DUE from version movement and emits issue payloads on stdout for the caller to file.

`allowed-tools` is declared to **restrict**, per CLAUDE.md: `Edit` and `Write` are deliberately absent, which is what makes "never edits anything" a contract rather than a promise. `Task` is present because Step 2 dispatches — a declared set that omits a tool the skill actually uses is a bug, not a tighter restriction.

**Not shipped.** This is maintainer-only tooling. It lives under `.claude/skills/` — a project-local skill, loaded only when working in this repo, never for plugin consumers. It is deliberately **not** under `plugin/skills/`, which is the plugin's shipped payload — #418 moved that payload into `plugin/`; this skill stayed at the repo root because it never ships. For the same reason its frontmatter `name` is the bare `upstream-drift` rather than CLAUDE.md's `claude-tweaks:{skill}` form: that namespace belongs to the shipped plugin, and claiming it here would imply this skill ships. The deviation is intentional, not drift.

## When to Use

- An upstream dependency released a new version and you want to know what this repo's own files now get wrong about it, before deciding whether to upgrade.
- You want to know what upstream can do that this repo has never used — the class of finding no assertion can produce, because there is nothing yet to assert against.
- A pin in `tools/upstream-drift/manifest.yml` changed, or you added an entry, and you want to see what the checks say about it now.

Not for: editing upstream, or editing `plugin/skills/**`. This skill produces findings; when they should become `by:upstream-drift` GitHub issues, `tools/upstream-drift/run.js` emits the deduplicated payloads on stdout and the caller — this skill's user, or a human piping the output — files them. Not for auditing this repo's own harness documentation — that is `/claude-tweaks:harness-health`.

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` may contain:

- `--dep <name>` — audit one manifest entry by its `name` (e.g. `impeccable-plugin`). Default: every entry in the manifest.
- `--latest-tag <tag>` — override the resolved latest tag. Use to preview a specific upgrade, or to work offline against a tag you already know. The installed side is never overridable — it is resolved from the artifact.
- `--drift-only` — run the deterministic half and report; skip the capability judgment and every network call it needs.
- `--capability-only` — skip the drift report. Use when the deterministic half was already run this session.
- `--json` — emit the raw findings array instead of the rendered report.

## Workflow

> **Parallel execution:** Use parallel tool calls aggressively — reading the manifest, resolving upstream tags, and fetching both file trees are independent and should run concurrently.

### Step 1 — Load the manifest and run the deterministic checks

From the repository root:

```bash
node -e "const{loadManifest}=require('./tools/upstream-drift/manifest.js');const{checkVersion,checkAssertions,replayFixtures,checkContentPins,isContentPinned}=require('./tools/upstream-drift/checks.js');const m=loadManifest('./tools/upstream-drift/manifest.yml');console.log(JSON.stringify(m.dependencies.map(d=>isContentPinned(d)?{name:d.name,upstream:d.upstream,contentPins:checkContentPins(d)}:{name:d.name,upstream:d.upstream,contractPaths:d['contract-paths'],version:checkVersion(d),assertions:checkAssertions(d),fixtures:replayFixtures(d)}),null,2))"
```

Use `node -e`, not a script file: inside `-e`, `require` resolves relative paths against the current working directory, which is what makes the `./tools/...` paths above correct. The same lines saved to a file resolve against the *file's* directory and fail with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.

`tools/upstream-drift/` is read-only input to this skill. Never edit `checks.js`, `manifest.js`, or `manifest.yml` from here — a manifest change is a deliberate act, not an audit side effect. If a check reveals the manifest itself is wrong (a pin naming a version that was never installed, a `contract-path` that resolves nowhere), report it as a finding and stop.

Filter to `--dep` if given. Under `--capability-only`, still run this step — the capability judgment needs `checkVersion`'s installed version to pick the diff's starting tag — but emit no drift findings from it.

**Content-pinned entries (`pin.versioning: none`).** The command above routes these through `checkContentPins` instead of the three probe checks — nothing is installed for the class, so `checkVersion` would misreport it as absent, and a real pin/fixture breach would go unseen. Steps 3-4's tag pair does not exist for a tagless upstream either: the class's capability posture is commit-based — compare the entry's `pin.commit` against the upstream default branch's HEAD (`gh api "repos/{upstream.repo}/commits/{default-branch}"`); newer commits mean new or changed upstream files to triage (a re-pin is a deliberate act: re-fetch the consumed files at the new SHA, recompute hashes, update the fixtures — never edit from this skill), and a pinned SHA no longer reachable upstream (history rewrite) is itself a drift finding for a human to resolve, never a test failure.

### Step 2 — Decide sequential or parallel

> **Parallel execution (conditional):** When more than one dependency is due, dispatch one Task agent per dependency. Otherwise, run Step 4 sequentially in the main thread.

Each dependency is fully independent — different upstream repos, different tags, different contract roots — so there is no shared state to serialize. When dispatching, follow `plugin/skills/_shared/subagent-output-contract.md`: give each agent a `Standard` model tier, the minimal input (the dependency's manifest entry, its Step 1 results, the repository root), and **inline the entire body of `judge-procedure.md` below its horizontal rule, verbatim**, into the agent's prompt. Agents see only their own prompt; a pointer to the file does not reach them. Require the four-value status line (`DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / NEEDS_CONTEXT / BLOCKED`) as the first line of the reply.

Skip this step entirely under `--drift-only`.

### Step 3 — Resolve the tag pair

Per dependency, resolve `{installed-tag}` and `{latest-tag}` as described in `judge-procedure.md` step 2. The diff runs from the **installed** tag, never from an arbitrary recent one — a capability report against a version this machine is not running describes work that cannot be done yet.

`--latest-tag` overrides the resolved latest. If the two tags are equal, that dependency contributes drift findings only.

### Step 4 — JUDGE

Read `judge-procedure.md` in this skill's directory and apply it. It is the single canonical procedure and is shared verbatim with Step 2's dispatch prompt; do not restate or paraphrase it here.

Substitute `{dep.name}`, `{installed-tag}`, `{latest-tag}`, and `{root}` before applying.

### Step 5 — Report

Render two tables, drift first, each sorted by `severity` then `confidence`. Never merge them — a broken contract and an unexplored opportunity are different asks of the reader.

```
## Upstream Drift — {dep.name} ({installed-tag} → {latest-tag})

### Drift — {n} finding(s)
| Severity | What broke | Local file | Evidence |

### Capability — {n} finding(s)
| Severity | Upstream | What it is | Why it matters | Local seam | Effort |
```

If both tables are empty, say so in one line and stop. An all-green run is the expected steady state; do not pad it with near-findings to justify the run.

Under `--json`, emit the findings array from `judge-procedure.md` step 8 instead, and skip Next Actions.

## Next Actions

Render as plain markdown, one paste-ready command per line. Order by context: lead with the file-the-findings line when any finding is `severity: high`; lead with the take-the-upgrade line when the drift table is empty and the capability table is not; otherwise lead with the first line as listed below. Bold the leading command and suffix its annotation `(recommended)` — exactly one line carries the recommendation on every path.

`/claude-tweaks:capture` — capture the capability findings as backlog records; drift findings can instead ride `tools/upstream-drift/run.js`, which emits deduplicated `by:upstream-drift` issue payloads on stdout for the caller to file
`/claude-tweaks:capture 'upgrade {dep.name} to {latest-tag} and re-pin tools/upstream-drift/manifest.yml'` — record the upgrade itself as work
`/upstream-drift --dep <name>` — re-run against a single manifest entry
`/claude-tweaks:tidy` — fold anything captured into a backlog-hygiene pass

## Component-Skill Contract

`/upstream-drift` is a **standalone-only** skill today — nothing in this repo invokes it, and `docs/skill-graph.md` records no edge to it. The `## Next Actions` block always renders.

The runner (`tools/upstream-drift/run.js`) is not a parent either: it never invokes this skill — the split runs the other way, with the runner emitting issue payloads on stdout and the skill (or a human piping the output) filing them. No runner-set flag exists, so nothing gates `## Next Actions` on one. `$PIPELINE_RUN_DIR` is **not** a signal here either: that variable marks a `/claude-tweaks:flow` pipeline run, and a scheduled drift sweep is not a pipeline orchestrator.

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Reading upstream release notes to decide what changed | All five Impeccable `skill-v4.0.x` releases carry byte-identical bodies while 4.0.2 → 4.0.4 changes 300+ files — the notes report "nothing changed" and are wrong in the clean-bill-of-health direction |
| Treating an upstream's documented *runtime behavior* as an assertion this repo can rely on | A doc describes intent, not what the environment does — a behavioral claim is only a contract once a fixture executes it in the target environment; until then it is an upstream assertion this repo has adopted, precisely the drift class this skill exists to catch. See `[IL-113]` for the sandbox measurement that surfaced this |
| Grepping this repo for an upstream file's name to decide whether it is handled | Only finds files that already mention it; structurally cannot find the file whose defect is total silence (`[IL-15]`) — which is the exact defect the capability class exists to catch |
| Assuming the upstream repo's layout matches the installed artifact's | Two entries against one upstream repo need different contract roots — `impeccable-cli` maps identically, `impeccable-plugin` maps under `plugin/`. Resolve the prefix from evidence, per entry |
| Diffing the whole upstream tree | Upstreams that vendor one source tree per agent harness report every change once per mirror — fifteen times over, for Impeccable at 4.0.4 |
| Diffing the canonical source directory instead of the contract root | `skill/` misses the four `reference/degraded/*.md` files that exist only as build outputs — the contract root is the subtree that mirrors what an upgrade actually delivers |
| Diffing from the latest tag to the one before it | The report then describes an upgrade path this machine is not on; the installed tag is the only correct starting point |
| Emitting a capability finding that names a file without saying what it does | A listing is not a triage — the finding must be actionable without re-running the diff or having network access |
| Re-deriving a deterministic check's verdict by reading the file yourself | `checks.js` owns that half; a second opinion here manufactures disagreement between two sources that were supposed to be one |
| Editing `tools/upstream-drift/manifest.yml` to silence a failing check | Re-pinning is a deliberate upgrade decision, not an audit side effect — the audit reports, a human re-pins |
| Padding an all-green run with near-findings | Zero findings is the expected steady state; noise here trains the reader to skim the run that finally matters |
