// tools/upstream-drift/run.js — the upstream-drift auditor's entry point.
//
// Wires the manifest (manifest.js) and the deterministic checks (checks.js)
// into a runnable sweep: decides which dependencies are DUE, converts the
// checks' output into fingerprinted findings, and deduplicates those against
// already-filed `by:upstream-drift` issues so a re-run over unresolved drift
// updates rather than duplicates.
//
// Maintainer-only tooling. Nothing under plugin/bin/ may import from here —
// the import is one-way, tools/ -> plugin/bin/lib/health-core/, and a test in
// tests/run.test.js pins that direction.
//
// ─── Why there is no rotation cursor ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// The four shipped health sweeps (plugin/bin/{code,harness,journey,docs}-health.js)
// rotate through targets on a 90-day cursor because there is always more
// repo to audit and no signal saying which part changed. Here the signal is
// exact: nothing is worth looking at until a version moves, and everything
// is worth looking at the moment one does. A cursor would sit on a real
// breaking bump for up to a rotation period. Triggers are version-driven —
// see isDue() below.
//
// That absence is also what makes this file's half of the record's AC6
// ("dry-run writes nothing to the health-state branch and stamps no cursor")
// structural rather than conditional: there is no cursor to stamp, and no
// durable-state writer is imported at all. The one real write this file
// performs is the local dedup cache, and --dry-run gates it.
//
// ─── This file does not call gh for writes ───────────────────────────────
//
// It emits issue *payloads* on stdout. Creating, reopening and commenting on
// issues is the caller's turn to take (the `/upstream-drift` skill, or a
// human piping the output) — the same split the four shipped sweeps use, and
// the reason `--dry-run` can promise "creates, edits or closes no issue"
// without needing to gate a network call that was never here.
