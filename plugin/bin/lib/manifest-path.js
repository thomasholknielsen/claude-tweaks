// path — but anything reading a manifest at an ARBITRARY historical ref (the
// release pre-check's branch reads, the version-bump walk, the post-commit
// release nudge's parent comparison) straddles the boundary and would otherwise
// report a pre-cutover commit as having no manifest, i.e. as never having
