// bin/lib/residue/probes/worktrees.js — leftover git worktrees for the
// residue sweep. Reports every worktree other than the main working tree
// and this run's own (excluded via `scope.headBranch`, mirroring
// `probeBranches`'s self-exclusion) — another session's live worktree, or a
// stale one nobody tore down.
//
// `REAPER_DOMAIN` distinguishes the two permanently separate worktree
// domains from `docs/decisions/0004-worktree-two-domain-convention.md`:
// `.claude/worktrees/` (native `EnterWorktree`, auto-collected by the
// `SessionStart` reaper — `bin/lib/hooks/worktree-reap.js`) versus
// `.worktrees/` (git-fallback `git worktree add`, cleaned up only by
// superpowers' `finishing-a-development-branch`, never by the reaper). A
// finding's evidence line says which domain it's in precisely because that
// determines whether leaving it alone is safe (the reaper will eventually
// collect it) or a real leak (it never will).
//
// Lock handling distinguishes a live session (do not touch) from an
// abandoned lock (a crashed/killed session's leftover) via a real
// liveness probe (`process.kill(pid, 0)`), not just lock presence — a
// locked-but-dead worktree is exactly the case a human needs to see, not
// one this probe should silently treat as "someone's using it."
