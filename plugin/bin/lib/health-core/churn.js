// Count commits touching any of `relPaths` since `sinceMs` (epoch ms). Returns
// 0 (not an error) when git is unavailable, paths don't exist, or there is no
// churn — the caller treats 0 as "nothing changed," not a failure signal.
// relPaths may be exact file paths or glob pathspecs — git's pathspec
// matching accepts both.
//
// Shared by harness-health/scope.js, journey-health/scope.js, and
// docs-health/scope.js — previously three near-identical copies of this
// function (down to an identical epoch-boundary date-parsing bug
// independently discovered and fixed three separate times before this
// extraction; see git history for journey-health/scope.js commit 7f6993f and
// docs-health/scope.js commit 8bbb3af).
//
// Memoized per exact (root, relPaths, sinceMs) triple, module-level and
// process-lifetime: selectTarget is called once per slot in a --budget > 1
// loop, and nothing on disk changes between slots of the same run — without
// caching, every slot re-spawns a `git log` subprocess (up to a 30s timeout)
// per remaining candidate, purely wasted I/O that scales with budget times
// candidate count. A call whose inputs genuinely changed (a different
// sinceMs after a cursor bump) still gets a fresh read. The cache is never
// invalidated against external git-history changes made mid-process — this
// is intentional for the one-shot-CLI-process usage this function is built
// for (each CLI invocation is a fresh Node process, so the cache never
// outlives a single command); see the "caches identical calls" test
// alongside this module for the explicit, deliberately-tested contract.

    // epoch-literal syntax was tried as a fix but verified (via direct
    // experimentation) to be unreliable for small values: git's fuzzy
    // approxidate parser treats a small `@<N>` as an ambiguous relative
    // offset from "now" rather than an absolute timestamp, so `--since=@0`
    // silently degrades to "since right now" once any time at all has
    // elapsed since the commit — worse than the original bug. A full ISO
