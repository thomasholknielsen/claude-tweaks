// Shared cache-read + issueIndex-load + within-batch-dedup + decide/dispatch
// loop for every health producer's cmdValidateFindings (harness-health,
// journey-health, docs-health) — previously ~15 lines byte-for-byte
// duplicated across all three CLI entrypoints
// (bin/harness-health.js/bin/journey-health.js/bin/docs-health.js).
//
// deps: { readCache, decide, toIssuePayload } are each domain-specific
// (their own cache shape, dedup rules, and issue-payload projection), so
// they're injected rather than hardcoded here — this module owns only the
// dedup/dispatch control flow shared by all three, not the domain logic.
//
// opts: { root, issuesPath, toolName, survivors, verifiedAsOf } — survivors is
// the caller's own array of already-validated, fingerprinted findings.
// verifiedAsOf (#117, optional): the git sha the caller resolved ONCE at the
// start of this run (health-core/read-commit.js) — passed straight through
// to toIssuePayload per finding, never re-resolved here. Absent/null is a
// valid value (git unavailable) and simply omits the stamp line downstream.
// Returns { cache, payloads, seen, wontfixSuppressed } — cache is the mutated
// in-memory cache object (the caller still owns persisting it via its own
// writeCache), payloads is the array of issue payloads to emit, seen is the
// Set of fingerprints processed this run (for the run-record's `fingerprints`
// field), and wontfixSuppressed is the array of fingerprints suppressed this
// run because their matching GitHub issue carries the `wontfix` label.
//
// wontfixSuppressed exists because the issue index is the ONLY place that
// reading lives, and it is exactly what a `gh`-absent (or GitHub-unreachable)
// firing cannot rebuild. A run that does have the index therefore has to hand
// the decision forward: the caller persists these fingerprints into the
// durable `declined` slice on the health-state branch, which does survive a
// scheduled Routine firing's fresh container (the local gitignored cache does
// not — see health-core/cache.js's header). Without this hand-off, a standing
// `wontfix` decision silently lapses the moment a firing can't reach GitHub,
// and the suppressed finding is re-filed as brand new.
