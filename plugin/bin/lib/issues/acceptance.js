// and the acceptance-gap sweep on both work-record drivers (_shared/github-pr-scan.md's scope
// under github-issues, skills/tidy/step-1-records.md's Shape 8 under local-files) all call in
// rather than restate it.
//
// Deliberately absent: "backend code with no route/component/page touched." That category is
// not decidable from a path list. In the layouts this runs against, UI and backend share a
// root (`src/`, `lib/`, `app/`), so any prefix broad enough to catch `src/services/pay.ts`
// also catches `src/components/Button.tsx`. Anything unmatched below falls through to
// `interactive` — that costs a browser walk which finds nothing, whereas a wrong
// non-interactive match skips acceptance verification silently. That asymmetry is why the
// category stays out rather than being half-covered by prefixes.

// Payload paths are spelled two ways across this plugin's own `plugin/` payload cutover

// after it cites `plugin/skills/…`/`plugin/bin/…`/`plugin/.claude-plugin/…`. Both spellings
// are listed explicitly rather than folded into an optional-prefix regex, because the
// prefix is NOT generic: only the payload directories moved. `docs/`, `tests/` and `perf/`
// stayed at the repo root, and a consumer project's own `plugin/src/...` must keep falling
// through to `interactive`.
