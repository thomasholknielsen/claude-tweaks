// Expand-contract (refs #647): permittedGrants' flat top-level
// `bornReady`/`bornAuthorized`/`reason` keys are a transitional twin of the
// per-grant `grants.{bornReady,bornAuthorized}.{granted,reason}` shape — the
// flat single `reason` could pair a granted bornReady with the other grant's
// denial text, which is the bug the per-grant shape fixes. Removal condition:
// delete the flat keys at the first release on or after 2026-11-16 (ship date + 3 months, policy-deprecations.md's dated-backstop shape), re-running `grep -rn "permittedGrants" plugin/skills/ plugin/bin/` first to confirm every consumer still reads `grants.*`.

// a record to a class at all, and is absent here deliberately — trust.js already
// pins that kind's verdict to 'insufficient-evidence', and a redundant deny means
// neither module can open the bucket on its own.
//
// An allowlist, not a denylist naming 'unstructured'. The design's Phase 3 note
// warns that "a consumer switching over three kinds silently drops" the fourth;
// a denylist inverts that failure rather than fixing it — it would grant to any
// fifth kind a later provenance change introduces, and to a row whose `kind` is
