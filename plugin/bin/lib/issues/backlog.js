// condition" (skills/backlog/refine-headless.md), itself only reached once that
// mode's own Step 0 ceiling/opt-in gate has passed (see the caller
// precondition documented at the top of machine-grant-outlook.md) — so a
// human-filed record is never counted under refused here, exactly as
// the grant chain's own candidate fetch drops it before the chain. Origin is the
// only axis this pre-filter aligns: funnelBuckets routes a ready, ungranted
// record into `specified` regardless of open blockers, while the grant chain's
// Step 1 candidate fetch drops blocked records — so `eligible` can still
// exceed the grant chain's candidate count by that blocked population.
// Without the pre-filter, a human-filed record whose class trust
// ALSO happens to be non-clean gets misattributed to refused.trust by
// evaluateGrantGate's gate order (gate 2 runs before gate 3, so gate
// 3/origin never individually fires for it) even though the grant chain's own
// candidate fetch would never have considered it in the first place — this
// was #1387's reported discrepancy between overview's reported refusal
// counts and the grant chain's own candidate-set size for the same backlog
// state. Excluded records are counted via `excludedOrigin` rather than
// folded into `refused`, so a reader can reconcile the funnel header's
// `specified N` total against `eligible.length + refused-total +
// excludedOrigin`. Outside that policy shape, every record — human- and
// agent-filed alike — is refused under `ceiling` or
// `grant-origination-opt-in` before gates 2/3 ever run, so the
// misattribution bug structurally cannot occur there; this call falls back
// to running evaluateGrantGate for every record with no pre-filter at all,
// exactly preserving pre-fix behavior for that policy shape (`excludedOrigin`
// stays 0). When the pre-filter is active, this runs evaluateGrantGate's
// FIRST PHASE only (gates 1-3 — ceiling, opt-in, needs:definition, class
// trust — gate 3/origin is now structurally unreachable inside this call,
// since the pre-filter already removed every record it would have refused):
// gate 4's grant-check is an LLM judgment overview must never run, per its
// "entirely mechanical" contract. So `eligible` means "will reach the grant
// unit's own grant-check on a future firing", never "will be granted" —
// gates 4-5 can still refuse. policy is evaluateGrantGate's own policy shape
// ({ ceiling, grantOriginationEnabled } suffices for phase 1);
