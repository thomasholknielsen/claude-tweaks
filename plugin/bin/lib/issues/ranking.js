// Pure: "what should I build next" ranking, shared by /claude-tweaks:backlog's
// overview mode and /claude-tweaks:help's Priority Order/Tie-Breaking (extracted
// from /help's prose-only rules so both consumers compute the identical order).
// Tie-break order: priority band (high first) -> unblocks-count (most other
// candidates in the same input array it unblocks, first) -> file-overlap-free
// (no shared keyFiles with another candidate in the array, first) -> size band
// (low first) -> hasPlan (true first). Every input this needs (the unblocks
// graph, file-overlap groups, hasPlan) must be precomputed by the caller and
// attached to each candidate — this function does no I/O, mirroring record.js
// and grouping.js's purity contract. Candidates *may* carry a top-level
// `blockedBy` or `facets.blockedBy` array (native/local-driver blocker data);
// when absent, blockers fall back to body-text parsing — see blockersOf for
// the exact precedence.

// candidate -> number[]. THE single blocker-precedence decision, shared by
// computeUnblocksCount here, funnelBuckets (backlog.js), and #515's import —
// never re-implement it at a call site. Precedence: an unsynced fallback
// record (`facets.unsynced === true`) short-circuits to `[]` FIRST — its
// blocker ids (when present) live in the local-record namespace, a different
// id space from the GitHub numbers in a merged set, and must never
// cross-match them (parent #512 promise F1); this helper owns the rule so
// every consumer inherits it. Then: top-level `blockedBy` (attached by the
// overview's native fetch, or any caller that resolved blockers itself)
// wins; then the local-files driver's `facets.blockedBy` (already
// native-shaped frontmatter data); then record.js's parseDependencies over
// the body (work-links: body-text). Both explicit tiers are authoritative
// even when empty — `[]` means "confirmed no blockers", never "fall through
// to prose". Callers must not mutate the returned array — the two explicit
// tiers return live references into the candidate's own data.

// incident prose, not a hypothetical) while blockersOf(c) resolves empty:
// prose claims a dependency, but neither the native graph, the local driver,
// nor a canonical line backs it — the ranker is about to treat this candidate
// as unblocked, and the caller should say so loudly. The breadth is
// deliberate: this only fires when resolved blockers are empty and only ever
// renders a flag, never acts — an occasional false positive costs a human a
// glance, while a false negative here is exactly the silent mis-ranking this
// check exists to prevent, so it still never crosses a newline. Fires only on
// EMPTY resolved blockers by design: a partially wired record (non-empty
// blockedBy missing some prose-mentioned id) is not flagged — prose #N
// mentions have no mechanical ground truth, so partial-coverage checking
// would guess. `mention` is the trimmed full containing line of the first
