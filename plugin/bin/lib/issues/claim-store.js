// it, push with `--force-with-lease`), falling back to the contents-API PUT
// implementation below only when git-CAS fails for a transport reason (no
// git push credential — an MCP-only sandbox, for instance) or a secondary
// rate limit (#787's amendment: the contents-API claim writes were the
// fleet's most-contended endpoint; git-protocol operations cost zero API
// budget). Both the claim-side preflight CLI and
// `bin/lib/reconcile/release-merged.js`'s release path delegate their I/O
// here so there is exactly one code path performing this keyspace's writes,

//
// The `deps.ghApi` seam is injectable (never real `gh` in tests):
// `ghApi(args)` is invoked as if `gh api ${args.join(' ')}` and returns a
// non-throwing `{stdout, failure, status}` — the same object shape
// release-merged.js's own (pre-extraction) ghApi already used, extended
// with `status` so a 404 can be told apart from a genuine failure.
// `defaultGhApi` below is the real implementation; release-merged.js keeps
// supplying its own ghApi (which never sets `status`) and no `gitRunner`,
// so `readClaimBlob`'s `absent` branch simply never fires there and it stays
// on the contents-API-only path deliberately — see release-merged.js's
// delegation comments for why that is exactly the pre-extraction behavior,
// unchanged. `deps.gitRunner` is optional — omitted, both functions skip

//
// `_shared/issue-claims.md`'s "The lock" step 1 documents a 404 as a normal

// `gh: Not Found (HTTP 404)` on stderr, so a thrown error whose text
// contains "HTTP 404" or "Not Found" is reported as `{status: 404,
// failure: null}` rather than folded into `network-failure`.
//
// A 422 is the other non-error rejection a claim write can hit: a lost race
// on a create-only write (someone else's landed first) or a sha-mismatch on
// a conditional write. Live-confirmed GitHub wording for the create-race
// case (gh-api-module-pattern skill): `Validation failed: Target issue has
// already been taken`. Accept the HTTP status text ("HTTP 422"), the reason
// phrase ("Unprocessable"), and the observed body text ("Validation
// failed") — any one of the three still classifies as a write-conflict
// (`status: 422`) rather than falling through to a generic
// `network-failure`, which is what `writeClaimBlob` uses to tell a lost
// race apart from a real transient failure (see that function).
//
// A 409 is the Contents API's own rejection for a conditional-write sha
// mismatch — the RECLAIM-path equivalent of the 422 create-race above (a
// stale/tombstone target someone else re-claimed between this read and this
// write). Symmetric with the 422 block: accept the HTTP status text ("HTTP
// 409"), the reason phrase ("Conflict"), or the sha-mismatch body wording
// ("does not match") — any one classifies as `status: 409`, the same
// write-conflict signal `writeClaimBlob` folds into `conflict: true`.
// Without this branch a lost reclaim race fell through to
// `network-failure`, routing `bin/claim-targets.js` to transient (exit 4)
// instead of contested (exit 3) — #723.

// share one root cause — trusting a lease that was re-derived AFTER the write
// decision was made:
//
//   * **C1 (lost update).** The contents-API fallback below used to re-derive
//     a fresh blob sha and write with it unconditionally. If another agent's
//     claim landed while the git-CAS attempt was failing, that write silently
//     clobbered it — a double-claim. The fallback now compares the fresh read
//     against `expectedContent` and reports a genuine contest instead.
//   * **I1 (spurious contest).** `writeClaimBlobGit`'s `--force-with-lease` is
//     leased on the whole `claims-registry` branch tip, not on this claim's
//     file, so ANY concurrent commit to the registry — including one claiming
//     an unrelated issue — rejects the push. Every caller treats a rejection
//     as a per-file contest (aborting a whole group claim, or stranding a live
//     claim whose label the rollback already stripped). A rejection now
//     triggers a fresh git read: content actually changed = a genuine contest,
//     reported as before; content unchanged = unrelated branch activity, so
//     the write retries on the fresh tip, up to `MAX_CAS_ATTEMPTS`. Still
//     spurious on the last attempt = `transport-failure` (transient — the
//     branch is too busy to land on), never a manufactured contest.
//
// Both verifications live strictly inside the `deps.gitRunner && sha` block.
// A caller with no `gitRunner` (or no `sha` lease) — `release-merged.js`'s
// contents-API-only path — reaches the PUT below exactly as it always did:
// no fresh read, and `expectedContent` neither needed nor consulted.
//
// `sha` here is the compare-and-swap lease for the transport tried FIRST —
// the git-CAS branch tip (a **commit** sha) when the preceding read went
// through git, the contents-API blob sha otherwise. The two shapes are never
// interchangeable, so a lease is NEVER carried across a transport fallback:
// handing a git tip sha to the contents API's `-f sha=` would be rejected as
// a 409/422 and misreport a transient git-side failure as a contest — the
// exact secondary-rate-limit-read-as-contested regression #787's amendment
// exists to prevent (record-697). On fallback this re-reads the blob through
// the contents API (`readClaimBlobContentsApi`) to derive a correctly-shaped
// lease AND to verify the content is still what this write's decision was
// based on (C1 above); a failure there returns that failure (never a spurious
// contest), and a now-absent or now-different target IS a genuine contest (the
// claim was released, broken, or re-taken since the git read).
//
// git-CAS is attempted whenever both a `gitRunner` dep AND a `sha` lease are
// present — including a create-only write (`createOnly: true`), which is the
// fleet's most-contended write and the whole reason for moving off the
// contents API: adding a new `claims/issue-{n}.json` is still a commit built
// on the current tip and protected by the same `--force-with-lease`, so the
// tip sha is a valid lease for it. `createOnly` only changes the fallback
// behavior: no fresh read (there is no existing blob to re-derive a sha
// from) and never a `-f sha=` argument on the PUT, so a create-only write
// keeps its create-vs-clobber semantics on either transport; its own
// post-rejection verification is `absent` vs not-absent rather than a content
// comparison, since a create-only write's premise is exactly "nothing is
// there". A git-CAS contest, once a fresh read confirms it is genuine, is
// reported as-is (never silently retried against contents-API — that would
// race the same write twice under two different concurrency mechanisms). A
// git-CAS secondary-rate-limit or transport-failure falls back to
// contents-API once.
//
// `sha` included in the contents-API fallback only when provided and this is
// not a create-only write: omitted = create-only (PUT rejects if the path
// already exists), present = conditional-update (must match the blob's
// current sha) — the create-vs-reclaim split `_shared/issue-claims.md`'s
// "The lock" steps 3-4 document. A `status: 422` or `status: 409` response (see
// `classifyGhApiError`) is a genuine write-conflict — someone else's
// create-only write landed first (422), or a conditional write's sha no
// longer matches because someone else's reclaim landed first (409) — and
// must resolve `ok: false` on its own, not fall through to the generic
// `status !== 404` formula below (422 / 409 !== 404 would otherwise read as
// success). Callers distinguish this from a transient `ghApi` failure via
// `conflict: true` vs a non-null `failure` — `_shared/issue-claims.md`'s
// "the lock" step 3: "a rejection on either transport is contested — same
// handling as `'live'`, not a retry." A consumer supplying its own `ghApi`
// that never sets `status` (e.g. `release-merged.js`) never sees
// `status === 422` or `status === 409` here, so its `ok` computation is
// unchanged by this branch — see that module's delegation comments.
