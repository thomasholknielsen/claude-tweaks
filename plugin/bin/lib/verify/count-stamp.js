// plugin/bin/lib/verify/count-stamp.js — suite-count regression stamp (#881).
// Persists the "tests" check's executed-test count across runs so a quieter
// suite is surfaced as a caveat instead of reading identical to a clean pass
// (IL-84: an enumerated glob silently excluded a whole test directory —
// fifteen tests never ran, and `npm test` still exited 0). This is a
// caveat/surfacing mechanism, not a hard gate: a legitimate removal also
// drops the count, so the caveat flags the drop for a human to judge rather
// than failing the run.
//
// Counts fail toward absence, matching extract.js's own rule (a wrong count
// would poison this module's comparison): a missing, unreadable, or
// malformed stamp reads as "no baseline yet" — bootstrap, never a false
// regression.
//
// Also home to the flaky-allowlist hit counter (#1925): `flakyHits` rides in
// the same stamp.
