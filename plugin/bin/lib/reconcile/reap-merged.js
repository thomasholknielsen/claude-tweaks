// bin/lib/reconcile/reap-merged.js — convergence check 2: reap worktrees
// whose branch's PR has merged. Parallel to (never a replacement for)
// `worktree-reap.js`'s existing content-identical ancestry check, which
// stays the reap signal for local-merge / no-forge projects — see #407's
// Non-Goals. Never touches a worktree a live session holds, regardless of
// PR state (`isWorktreeLocked`, reused verbatim from worktree-reap.js) —
// and never touches the CALLING session's own cwd worktree either (#644):
// `isWorktreeLocked` only catches a lock file another live session wrote,
// which says nothing about whether THIS process is standing inside the
// candidate right now (e.g. a session that just merged its own run's PR
// from inside that run's worktree, then calls reconcile in the same
// breath — no lock check catches that, since nothing about the lock
// changed). worktree-reap.js's own `reapWorktrees` already carries this
// exact guard (`here === real || here.startsWith(...)`, "never our own
// ground") — mirrored here rather than restated with different wording.
