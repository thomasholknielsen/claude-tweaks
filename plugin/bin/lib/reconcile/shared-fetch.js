// bin/lib/reconcile/shared-fetch.js — the one `git fetch` reconcile()
// performs per pass, shared by mirror (classify.js) and prune-remote.js,
// which each previously ran their own separate fetch (#820, D2).
//
// The fetch SHAPE is chosen by which of {mirror, remote-prune} this pass
// actually requested, not by one fixed shape for every caller (#820 final
// review). The two checks are provably disjoint today — session-start.js's
// FAST_CHECKS carries mirror, bin/hooks.js's BACKGROUND_CHECKS carries
// remote-prune, and tests/bin-lib/hooks/reconcile-background.test.js pins
// that partition — so each process now pays only for the fetch its own
// checks need:
//
//   remote-prune requested -> `git fetch --prune origin`, deliberately with
//     NO explicit timeoutMs. --prune (broader than mirror's single-ref
//     fetch) also drops stale tracking refs for branches already gone on
//     origin, so prune-remote stops re-examining them every pass.
//     prune-remote.js's own (now removed) fetch never passed a timeout
//     either, so it falls back to git-exec's DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS (10000ms) in
//     production and keeps honoring the CT_HOOKS_GIT_TIMEOUT_MS test-load
//     escape hatch — an explicit opts.timeoutMs would short-circuit that
//     hatch entirely (see resolveTimeout in git-exec.js).
//
//   mirror only -> `git fetch origin {integration}` under classify.js's own
//     FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS. This is session-start's inline hot path, where a slow
//     remote must not stall the caller for the full general budget — exactly
//     the rationale classify.js's constant documents, and applicable again
//     now that this fetch is no longer also serving remote-prune in the same
//     process.
//
//   both -> the `--prune` shape, the superset that safely serves both. Not
//     reachable under today's partition, but a future check reshuffle could
//     reintroduce it: widening mirror's fetch costs a little extra work,
//     whereas shrinking remote-prune's budget would silently break it.
//
// reconcile()'s own overall wall-clock budget (~18s, #820 D4) stays the
// backstop against a pathologically slow fetch under either shape.
