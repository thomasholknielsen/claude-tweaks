// candidates-dead-code.js — deterministic dead-code candidate generator for
// code-health's `focus=dead-code` scoping mode (see skills/code-health/
// focus-mode.md). Finds unreferenced module.exports symbols and orphaned
// files via grep-anchored heuristics — no AST. Candidates are INPUT to the
// judge (skills/code-health/SKILL.md Step 5), never filed directly; the
// judge and the verify gate remain the filter of record.
//
// Coverage (stated explicitly, never implied total — IL-110):
//   - JS/TS files only (.js/.ts/.tsx/.jsx/.mjs/.cjs). Markdown is out of
//     scope entirely (prose-reachable, not import-reachable).
//   - Only the CommonJS `module.exports = { a, b, c }` shorthand-brace
//     export shape is recognized (single- or multi-line). ESM `export`
//     statements, the `module.exports.NAME = ...` single-assignment form,
//     and aliased (`{ a: renamed }`) or computed keys are NOT extracted —
//     accepted false negatives, consistent with the conservative direction.
//   - Reference detection is an identifier-bounded bare-symbol search across
//     every tracked, non-ignored file — an unrelated same-named identifier
//     elsewhere in the tree makes a dead export read live. Accepted
//     false-negative, per the spec's explicit policy. Bounded by the JS
//     identifier character class (which includes `$`), not by `\b`; see
//     identifierBounded below. A symbol whose own definition and only uses
//     share one line (e.g. a self-recursive function called nowhere else)
//     reads as unreferenced, since the whole line is skipped as a
//     definition — correct for the export question being asked.
//   - Reference detection is NOT transitive, and the two checks do not feed
//     each other: an export used only from a file this same scan reports as
//     an orphan still reads as referenced, because a dead file's text stays
//     in the reference-search set. Deleting an orphan can therefore expose
//     exports this run called live — one layer per run, found by re-running
//     after the removal lands, never in a single pass. Accepted false
//     negative, same conservative direction as the rest of this block.
//   - Orphan-file detection is specifier-NAME-based, not module-resolution
//     based: a file counts as referenced when any other tracked file's
//     require/import specifier ends in its basename (extension-insensitive),
//     whatever directory that specifier points at. Two same-named files in
//     different directories therefore rescue each other, and a stale
//     commented-out import rescues its target — both accepted false
//     negatives. A directory index (`x/index.js`) additionally accepts its
//     own directory's name, since `require('./x')` is the only form that
//     ever names it. Files nothing statically names but something invokes
//     externally are the entrypoint rules' job, not this function's.
//   - Dynamic patterns are out of scope by construction: a computed
//     `require(x + y)` call site is never treated as a static reference to
//     whatever it might load at runtime, and a spread-based barrel
//     (`{ ...require('./a') }`) extracts no symbols from the spread token
//     (skipped, not crashed). Re-exported names are still caught as
//     referenced if used by their bare name anywhere, since reference
//     detection is symbol-name-based, not import-statement-based.
//   - The one hardcoded exception: `bin/lib/hooks/*.js` is treated as an
//     implicit entrypoint set whenever `bin/hooks.js` exists and contains
//     the string-keyed `require('./lib/hooks/' + event)` pattern — this
//     repo's own hook dispatcher convention, invisible to every other rule
//     here because the required path is never a string literal.
//   - The entrypoint rules resolve against a payload root, tried as both `''`
//     (the conventional layout) and `plugin/` (this repo's own, after the #418
//     payload cutover) — see `PAYLOAD_PREFIXES` in `detectEntrypoints`.
//   - Files that cannot be read, and files containing a NUL byte (a real
//     source file can hold one in a string literal, not just a binary can),
//     are excluded from the scan entirely — never candidates, and never
//     searched for references to other files' symbols either. They are
//     reported by name and reason in `scanDeadCode`'s `skippedFiles`, so the
//     gap is visible in the coverage report rather than implied away.
//   - A test file matching this repo's own test-discovery naming convention
//     (basename ending `.test.js`/`.test.ts`/`.spec.js`/etc. — see
//     `isGlobDiscoveredTestFile` and `package.json`'s `test` script, whose
//     globs are all `*.test.js` under a `tests/` directory) is EXCLUDED from
//     orphan-file candidacy
//     entirely, deliberately, as of this leaf's follow-up fix: such a file is
//     never `require`d/`import`ed by name — `node --test`'s own glob
//     discovery IS its reference — so treating it as a dead-file candidate
//     was pure noise, not signal (219 candidates on this repo, ~99% test
//     files, exhausting the judge's read budget before reaching the ~1
//     genuine finding; see `docs/plans/2026-08-09-code-health-focus-mode-
//     dead-code-ledger.md` item #1). The exclusion is scoped to file-orphan
//     candidacy only: a matching test file's own `module.exports` symbols
//     are still checked for `unreferenced-export` candidacy exactly like any
//     other file, since that question (is this exported symbol used
//     anywhere) is orthogonal to how the file itself gets loaded. A test
//     file that is a genuinely-orphaned file by some OTHER naming
//     convention (not matching the glob pattern) is still reported, same as
//     before — this is a scope boundary, not a blanket "skip test
//     directories" rule.
//
// Why there is no `grep`/`find` subprocess here. File discovery is one
// `git ls-files` call — git's own authoritative .gitignore evaluation,
// producing one explicit file list (never a bare recursive grep, which
// silently skips gitignored files in one direction and reads them in the
// other). Everything after that runs in-process: the listed files are
// already read into memory for export extraction, so reference and orphan
// checking scan the same in-memory text with `RegExp` rather than spawning
// a second recursive tool that might disagree with git about what is
// ignored. A future reader should not go looking for a grep subprocess.
//
// Why two functions. `scanDeadCode` does the whole scan and returns the
// rich `{ candidates, scannedFiles, skippedFiles, discoveryFailed, discoveryReason? }`
// shape that focus-mode.md's zero-candidates report needs (IL-115:
// `discoveryFailed` distinguishes a broken scan from a clean repo — the two
// used to collapse into the identical `scannedFiles: 0` sentinel).
// `candidatesDeadCode`
// is a thin wrapper returning just `.candidates`, matching the spec's pinned
// signature — needed as its own function because `JSON.stringify` of an array
// drops any extra properties hung off it, so the counts cannot ride along on
// the array that focus-mode.md's `node -e` wiring serializes.
