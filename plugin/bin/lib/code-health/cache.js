// Cursors, the sub-threshold "remembered" cache, the retry queue, and run
// history are durable instead — they live on the health-state branch (see
// _shared/health-state.md), not local disk, since local disk doesn't survive
// a scheduled cloud-routine firing's container recycling between runs.

// includeDeclined: true (#171) — a wontfix suppression read off a live
// GitHub label is also persisted to the durable `declined` slice, so it
// survives a scheduled cloud-Routine firing's container recycling the way
// the local cache (this module's other half) explicitly does not. See
// buildValidateFindingsUpdate below and dedup.js's `durableDeclined` param.
const durable = createDurableState('code-health', { includeRemembered: true, includeDeclined: true });

// computeChurn (union-denominator ratio + the `stayed` field) now lives once
// in health-core/runs.js, shared by all four health-suite engines — re-export
// it here so existing call sites (bin/code-health.js,
// tests/bin-lib/code-health/*) keep importing it from this module.

// Pure: computes the next durable-state object for a validate-findings run.
// current: { cursors, remembered, retryQueue, runs } — the current durable
// health-state shape (as returned by readDurableState).
// opts: { areasSwept: string[], hashes: { [areaId]: string },
//         rememberCandidates: [{ id, severity, risk }],
//         runRecord: { runId, runAt, fingerprints }, now?: number }
//
// rememberCandidates (not a pre-computed delta object) so the "already
// remembered, don't touch it" check below is evaluated against THIS
// invocation's own `current.remembered` — writeDurableState's CAS loop calls
// its mutator fresh (a real refetch) on every retry attempt, so computing
// the delta here, inside the mutator, means the check always sees the
// freshest available state instead of a snapshot the caller read before the
// CAS loop even started (which could be stale by the time of the write —
// e.g. a concurrent code-health firing in the intervening window).
//
// This is the exact logic bin/code-health.js's cmdValidateFindings hands to
// writeDurableState as its mutator — extracted here (no git, no gh, no I/O)
// so its four behaviors (selective per-swept-area cursor update, un-swept-area
// cursor preservation, remembered-candidate merge, run-history append) can be
// unit tested directly with plain-object fixtures. See
// tests/bin-lib/code-health/build-validate-findings-update.test.js.
// wontfixSuppressed (#171): [fingerprint] — findings suppressed this run
// because their matching GitHub issue carries the `wontfix` label (dedup.js's
// decide() tags these with reason: 'wontfix-label'; the caller collects
// them). Folded into the durable `declined` slice so the suppression is
// still honored on a later firing whose local cache is empty — see
// dedup.js's `durableDeclined` param and health-core/mark.js's
// mergeWontfixIntoDeclined.
