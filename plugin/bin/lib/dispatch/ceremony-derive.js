// `standard` unless every materialized record already carried a
// `ceremony: fast-lane` header) as the only signal. Evidence: Dispatch hub
// run #9, 2026-08-26 — a +75/-2 test-only diff still ran the full `standard`
// wrap-up ceremony, ~8 of the firing's 43 minutes on ceremony nothing acted
// on.
//
// Pure — no git/fs I/O of its own. `wrap-up/SKILL.md`'s "Diff-derived
// ceremony default" step supplies `files` (parsed `git diff --numstat`
// output, `blast-radius-cli.js`'s `parseNumstat` shape: `{path, additions,
// deletions}[]`) and the run's current `ceremony-profile` value.
