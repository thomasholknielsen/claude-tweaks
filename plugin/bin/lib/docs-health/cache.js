// Cursors, the sub-threshold "remembered" cache, and run history are durable

// the floor is held in this durable slice instead of being filed, until it
// escalates or a deeper sweep lowers the bar. See createDurableState's own
// header comment for why this must be an explicit opt-in flag rather than
// inferred from runtime truthiness of `current.remembered`.
// includeDeclined: true — a `mark ... declined` disposition also persists
// here (not just the local gitignored cache), so it survives a scheduled
// Routine's fresh, stateless container. See bin/lib/health-core/mark.js's

// health-state shape (as returned by readDurableState). docs-health has a
// single kind ('doc') and no gap-scan concept, so this is simpler than
// harness-health's equivalent — no `kind` param, no `__gapScan` cursor.

// rememberCandidates (not a pre-computed delta object), and the "already
// remembered, don't touch it" merge below, mirror

// see that file's header comment for the full rationale (the check must be
// evaluated against `current.remembered`, the freshest state
// writeDurableState's CAS loop just fetched, not a caller-side snapshot).
// wontfixSuppressed: [fingerprint] — findings suppressed this run because
// their matching issue carried the `wontfix` label. Folded into the durable
// `declined` slice so the suppression outlives the issue index it was read
// from; see health-core/mark.js's mergeWontfixIntoDeclined.
