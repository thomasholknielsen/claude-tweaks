// 24 workers plus two suites: 83% of the old budget. The timeout demonstrably

// 10000ms is ~4x the worst duration observed at peak contention. It is a
// CEILING, not a cost — the normal case is ~45ms, and the ceiling only binds
// when git is already pathologically slow. In that situation the alternative

// `indeterminate` verdict to test code that expects a definitive answer.
// Raising DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS itself would weaken production's safety net
