// bin/lib/hooks/run-integrity.js — run-integrity detection (inform tier, read-only).
// Distinguishes a run genuinely in progress from one whose work already shipped
// while bookkeeping stayed open (#364's failure mode). Pure read side: no writes,
// no event appends, no git mutations, no fetch (SessionStart must be offline-safe).
//
// Fail-open is per-field: every evidence field that cannot be determined is null,
// and any null forces 'in-progress'. A wrong verdict here costs one misleading
// advisory line, so every ambiguity resolves toward NOT alarming.
//
// Measured boundaries inherited from #371's ledger (see that spec's
// work/task0-findings.md): skill_invoked events exist only for MODEL-INITIATED
// Skill tool calls — a human typing /claude-tweaks:wrap-up leaves no event, and
// runs predating the ledger have none at all. Both are why the verdict requires
// at least one skill_invoked of any kind (pre-ledger precondition) and treats a
// present wrap-up event as proof the procedure ran; absence of a wrap-up event
// alone is never a verdict. Subagent Skill calls ARE visible (parent-session
// hooks, agent-tagged in the payload), so dispatch-driven wrap-ups do register.
