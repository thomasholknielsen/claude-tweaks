// bin/lib/hooks/teardown-run.js — `bin/hooks.js teardown-run --run <dir> [--merged|--abandoned]`
// (#594). Composes five existing, separately-tested mechanics behind one subcommand instead of
// the 4-5 hand-assembled commands a finished /flow run needed before this: (1) close-run's
// terminal-state flip (close-run-state.js), (2) archive-merged.js's git-mv-and-commit archival,
// (3) worktree-reap.js's lock/eligibility predicate for worktree removal, (4) a local branch
// delete, (5) the remote ref delete `pr-first-merge-post-merge.md` Step 5 already specifies.
//
// Cardinal invariant (bin/hooks.js's own header comment): this is dispatched the same way
// close-run is, so it never sets a non-zero exit and never throws past its own boundary — every
// step is try/skip/report. A locked worktree, `--abandoned`, or a branch-name-matches-integration
// guard all SKIP their step and report why; none of them abort the remaining steps, since a
// locked worktree doesn't block branch/ref cleanup that doesn't depend on it.
