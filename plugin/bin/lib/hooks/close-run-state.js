  // run its OWN caller identified, and its Step 3 (worktree removal) runs
  // moments later in the same invocation — so the worktree is GUARANTEED
  // to still exist at this point regardless of whether the run is actually
  // foreign, making the check fire unconditionally (never a real signal)
  // for any run whose sessionId was never recorded, permanently refusing a
