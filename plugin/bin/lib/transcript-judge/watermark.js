// plugin/bin/lib/transcript-judge/watermark.js
// Evaluation watermark for skills/_shared/transcript-judge.md's shared
// judge-dispatch harness (moved from plugin/bin/lib/feedback/watermark.js, #856).
// A second judge run against the same transcript re-judges the whole thing
// from byte zero unless something records where the previous judge left
// off. This module is that record: derive the watermark's on-disk path
// from the transcript path AND a consumer key (so two consumers judging
// the same transcript never share state), read/write the watermark JSON,
// and convert the recorded byte offset back into a line number for the
// dispatch prompt. Every fs call is an injectable default param (same
// shape as plugin/bin/lib/feedback/file-feedback.js's runner/writeFile
// params) so tests never touch real disk.
//
// readWatermark degrades open: a missing or corrupt watermark file returns
// null, never a throw — the shared contract's prose treats null as "no
// prior evaluation," not an error. writeWatermark does the opposite: it
// lets a real write failure propagate. Swallowing that here would make the
// caller's own degrade-open handling untestable and undocumented at the
// wrong layer — the consumer's own prose is responsible for catching a
// writeWatermark throw and reporting it without aborting the evaluation.
//
// Consumer keys are enumerated once, in plugin/skills/_shared/
// transcript-judge.md's "Consumer parameterization" — never restated here.

// Buffer), not code-unit-based, so a transcript containing multi-byte UTF-8

// fingerprint hashes: a judge dispatched fresh has no candidate finding of its own yet, so it has
// nothing to hash and compare against a stored hash. Rendering the subject text instead gives the
// judge something it can actually act on ("omit findings matching them" was structurally
// unreachable when "them" was a list of 8-hex hashes). Joined with "; " rather than ", " since
// subject text is free-form prose that may itself contain commas.
