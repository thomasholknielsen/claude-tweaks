// here rather than hard-coding the pair. Precedence mirrors bin/resolve-policy
// (resolvePolicyKeys' uniform alias rule): the new NAME wins whenever it is
// present, in any file order; the old name contributes only when the new one
// is absent. This is a raw-string read — no type coercion — so each reader
// below still applies its own literal interpretation, exactly as before.
// Assumes the alias's `migrate` is string-preserving (identity), which every
// alias a hook reads is today; a null-migrating alias would read as unset
// here — i.e. gate OFF — so a future non-identity alias for a hook-read key
// must extend this helper rather than rely on it.
