# Phase 5: CLAUDE.md Template and Guidelines

## Frontier singleton dispatch (record #221)

The synthesis step below — composing (Initial Mode) or patching (Update Mode) CLAUDE.md from Phase 2's reconnaissance — is dispatched as **one** `[Use: Frontier]` Task agent, never run inline and never fanned out: the main thread assembles the artifact bundle (Phase 2's reconnaissance findings, Phase 2f's pain-point list, and — Update Mode only — the existing CLAUDE.md's current text) and dispatches a singleton with that bundle.

**Output template.** Initial Mode returns the full composed CLAUDE.md body (per this file's section structure below); Update Mode returns one or more patches, each a `{section, before-excerpt, after-text, rationale}` block — the main thread applies each patch via Edit and commits, exactly as it already does for every other generated/patched file in this skill.

**Resolution.** `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-profile.js" frontier --unattended` in every headless context (a scheduled Routine's `/init` run); a plain interactive run omits `--unattended` and lets the resolver's own interactive-context precondition apply. No init-specific interactivity check is added — the resolver's existing gate is the single mechanism, here as everywhere else. Degrades to Capable per the resolver's own preconditions (cap exhausted, stance below `default`), logged in its `source`; this file never re-enumerates those preconditions. The dispatch structure — bundle assembly, singleton call, main-thread apply — never branches on which model the resolver returns; only the model differs.

CLAUDE.md is a self-improvement surface in the same sense as `/wrap-up`'s curation — its output compounds across every future session in the project, which is what justifies Frontier's premium here.

## Core Principle

CLAUDE.md describes **how to work in this codebase** — the patterns to follow, the commands to run, the conventions to respect, and the mistakes to avoid. It is an operator's manual for an existing system, not a wishlist of improvements.

Every section should answer: "If I'm about to make a change here, what do I need to know?" Things that don't exist yet (missing CI, missing tests, missing linting) are backlog work items, not entries in CLAUDE.md. The moment something is set up, _then_ it earns a place here.

This principle applies equally during initial generation and updates. When updating CLAUDE.md, evaluate every proposed change against: "Does this describe how to work in the codebase _as it is right now_?"

## Initial Mode Template

Produce CLAUDE.md from scratch following this template:

```markdown
# {project name}

{One-line description of what the project does.}

## Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|-------|------|
| ... | ... |

## Structure

{Directory tree showing key directories and their purpose — max 15 lines}

## Commands

{Key package scripts — what developers actually run daily.
Verify every command exists in package.json / Makefile / scripts before listing.}

## Conventions

{Observed naming, patterns, and rules — max 10 bullets}

## Philosophy

{Adaptive principles that calibrate how Claude approaches changes in this project.
Generated from the maturity classification detected in Phase 2h. See "Generating Philosophy" below.}

## Working Approach

How to execute any task here. These apply project-wide unless a more specific rule or instruction overrides them; use judgment on trivial tasks.

- **Think before coding.** State assumptions; ask rather than guess when uncertain. Push back when a simpler approach exists. Stop when confused.
- **Honest, not agreeable.** When the user proposes a direction, pressure-test it before agreeing — name the weakest assumption first, not the strengths. State disagreement plainly: no flattery openers, no hedging, no reflexive reassurance. If you genuinely can't find a flaw, say so rather than manufacturing one.
- **Simplicity first.** Write the minimum correct code for what was asked — nothing speculative, no abstractions for single-use code. ("Do it properly" above means correct, not more.)
- **Surgical changes.** Touch only what the task requires. Don't reformat or "improve" adjacent code. Match the surrounding style.
- **Goal-driven.** Define success criteria up front and loop until they're verified, rather than following steps blindly.
- **Read before you write.** Before adding code, read the file's exports, immediate callers, and shared utilities — duplicate logic usually already exists nearby.
- **Checkpoint multi-step work.** After each significant step, state what's done, what's verified, and what's left. Don't build on a state you can't describe back.
- **Fail loud.** "Done" is wrong if anything was skipped; "tests pass" is wrong if any were skipped. Surface uncertainty and partial results — never hide them.

## Testing

{Framework, run commands, file location, naming convention}

## Environment

{How to set up locally, where secrets live, required services}

## Git

{Commit convention, branch strategy, PR process}

## claude-tweaks Pipeline

**Artifacts:** design doc (one file, phases = `## Phase N` sections) → spec (one per work unit, via `/claude-tweaks:specify`) → `/claude-tweaks:flow`. No multi-phase plan files (`*-P1.md`, `*-P2.md`, …); a single plan per spec via `/superpowers:writing-plans`, stopped before its execution-choice offer, is expected and normal.

**Entry point:** `/claude-tweaks:specify` — accepts a topic (calls `/superpowers:brainstorming`), design-doc path, or a backlog work-record ref.

**`/claude-tweaks:flow`:** specs only — it rejects design docs. Defaults to `auto` (hands-off); pass `confirm`, `interactive`, or `hybrid` to change that.

**Superpowers overrides:** `/superpowers:brainstorming` stops after the design doc — route to `/claude-tweaks:specify`, never `/superpowers:writing-plans`. `/superpowers:subagent-driven-development` and `/superpowers:executing-plans` don't auto-invoke `/superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`.

## Don'ts

{Anti-patterns observed or inferred — things that would break the project's conventions.
This section is the highest-ROI output. See "Mining Don'ts" below.}
```

## Update Mode

Produce a **patch** — not a full rewrite. For each stale/drifted item the user approved:

```markdown
## CLAUDE.md Patches

### Patch 1: {description}
**Location:** Line {N}, section "{section}"
**Current:** `{current text}`
**Proposed:** `{new text}`
**Reason:** {why — e.g., "script renamed", "convention changed", "new stack added"}

### Patch 2: ...
```

Apply patches using Edit tool calls with precise `old_string` → `new_string` replacements. Never rewrite the entire file in Update Mode unless the user explicitly asks for it.

## Mining Don'ts

The Don'ts section prevents more mistakes than any amount of positive guidance. Don'ts are **guardrails for patterns that exist** — they describe what _not_ to do when working in this codebase. They are never aspirational.

**The filter:** A Don't must describe a pattern that exists in the codebase and should not be violated. If something doesn't exist yet (no CI, no tests, no linting, stale dependencies), that's a backlog item for improvement work — not a Don't.

**The shape:** one sentence of rule, one clause of why — around 150 bytes. CLAUDE.md is inherited by every dispatched subagent, not just loaded once per session, so a padded Don'ts section is billed per agent across every fan-out. When a Don't comes from a real incident, write the account of it somewhere it is allowed to be long — an incident log, the work record, the commit message — and only then compress it to the rule. Do it in that order: write the rule first and you pad it, because the incident is vivid and every detail feels load-bearing. A Don't needing three sentences of background to be believed is a compressed rule plus an account that belongs elsewhere, not a long rule.

Source Don'ts from:

1. **Inconsistencies found in 2f** — if the codebase uses both patterns, codify which is correct
2. **Common mistakes for this stack** — e.g., "don't use `getServerSideProps` in App Router" for Next.js 13+
3. **Observed anti-patterns in 2f** — if there are 50 `eslint-disable` for the same rule, that's a "don't disable rule X" candidate
4. **Convention violations** — if 95% of files use named exports, "don't use default exports" is a Don't
5. **Security footguns** — any auth, input validation, or data handling patterns that must not be violated

**Not Don'ts** (these belong in the backlog instead):

| Finding | Why not a Don't | Backlog example |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| No CI pipeline | Nothing to violate — it doesn't exist | "Set up CI — project uses {framework}, deploy to {target}" |
| No tests in `src/utils/` | Aspirational, not a guardrail | "Add test coverage for utils — {functions} are complex" |
| Dependencies 3 major versions behind | Work to do, not a constraint | "Upgrade {dep} — current: {v}, latest: {v}, breaking: {list}" |
| No linting configured | Can't enforce what isn't set up | "Set up linting — codebase uses {patterns}, {N} files" |
| Commented-out code blocks | Cleanup task, not a convention | "Clean up dead code in {files}" |

## Generating Philosophy

The Philosophy section adapts to the project's maturity classification (from Phase 2h). It contains two types of entries:

### Universal principles (include in all projects)

These apply regardless of project maturity:

- **Do it properly.** No display-only workarounds for data model issues, no "good enough" shortcuts that leave technical debt. If a value needs renaming, rename it everywhere including the database. If a type needs changing, change it at the source.
- **Assume zero cost.** Decide as if implementation is free. Never choose an inferior design because the better one "isn't worth the effort."
- **Assume zero time.** Decide as if implementation is instant. Never choose a shortcut because the proper approach "takes too long."
- **No implicit deferrals.** When something needs doing, either do it now or explicitly file a backlog work record via `/claude-tweaks:capture` — with a spec-shaped body (Current State / Deliverables / Acceptance Criteria) and a `Defer-reason:` from `_shared/deferral-gate.md` when an agent holds the context; a stub is for a human typing an idea. Never silently skip work or leave TODO comments without a corresponding backlog record.

### Maturity-dependent principles (adapt to classification)

Select the appropriate entries based on the detected maturity:

#### Greenfield / Pre-launch

```markdown
Greenfield, pre-launch. There are no users on the platform yet. Always prefer the correct solution over the safe-migration path: rename columns, change types, restructure schemas, break APIs, delete and rebuild. Use db:push not migrations. Don't add backward-compatibility shims, expand-contract phases, or feature-migration code — just make the change. Prefer latest stable versions, modern APIs, and clean implementations. When in doubt, choose the newest production-ready approach and build it right the first time.
```

#### Early Production

```markdown
Early production. The platform has users but the codebase is still young. Prefer correct solutions but use migrations (not db:push) for schema changes. Breaking API changes are acceptable with coordination — document them, version if needed. Backward-compatibility shims are acceptable for short periods (< 1 sprint) to ease transitions, then remove them. Prefer modern approaches for new code; refactor existing code toward modern patterns when touched.
```

#### Established

```markdown
Established codebase with active users. Schema changes require migrations with rollback plans. API changes follow expand-contract: add the new, migrate consumers, remove the old. Backward compatibility is required for published interfaces. Feature flags for risky changes. Prefer stability over novelty — adopt new patterns in new code, migrate existing code incrementally. Test coverage gates before refactoring shared code.
```

### Additional maturity-dependent entries

| Signal | Greenfield | Established |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Developer tooling | "Developer-first. Prefer powerful developer tools over simplified abstractions. Code-based config with type safety over UI-driven config without guardrails." | Omit (team may have different preferences) |
| Automation | "Automation over manual actions. Everything reproducible: Terraform first, CLI scripts second, documented manual steps only as last resort." | Same, but emphasize change management and approval processes |
| Dependencies | "Use latest stable versions. Upgrade aggressively." | "Pin versions. Upgrade deliberately with testing." |

**Important:** Only include entries that match the project. A greenfield project with no infrastructure doesn't need the automation entry. An established project with no published APIs doesn't need the expand-contract entry. Adapt, don't copy blindly.

## Working Approach (universal behavior block)

`## Working Approach` is the one **standard, non-adaptive** section in the template — include it verbatim in every generated CLAUDE.md (like the `## claude-tweaks Pipeline` section). It encodes universal task-execution behavior (think-before-coding, honest-not-agreeable, simplicity, surgical changes, goal-driven, read-before-write, checkpointing, fail-loud) so that **ad-hoc work outside the pipeline** — where no skill gate fires — still gets the same guardrails the lifecycle skills enforce. Update Mode's conformance check byte-compares this section against the template, so a project that edits or trims it reports drifted on every pass — verbatim is enforced, not just advised.

Two rules of thumb:

- **Complements Philosophy, doesn't repeat it.** Philosophy calibrates *how aggressive changes should be in this codebase* (maturity-dependent). Working Approach is *how to execute any task* (project-independent).
- **No hard token-budget rule (deliberate).** The popular 8-rule CLAUDE.md template adds a "hard per-task / per-session token budget, summarize-and-restart on breach" rule. claude-tweaks **omits it on purpose**: context management is the harness's job, and `_shared/auto-mode-contract.md` explicitly forbids the model from inserting context-window/budget stop prompts. Do not add a token-budget bullet here.

## Principles

- **How to work here, not what's missing** — every entry should help someone working in the codebase right now. Improvements belong in the backlog.
- **Observed, not aspirational** — document what the codebase actually does, not what it should do
- **Under 150 lines (default; override via `harness-health-always-loaded-budget` in `.claude-tweaks/policy.yml`)** — if it doesn't fit, it belongs in a skill or rule
- **Commands must work** — verify scripts exist before listing them
- **Don'ts are guardrails, not wishes** — they describe existing patterns that should not be violated, never infrastructure that doesn't exist yet
- **Philosophy adapts to maturity** — the same principle stated differently for greenfield vs established projects prevents both reckless breaking changes and unnecessary conservatism
- **Working Approach is standard, not adaptive** — include the universal behavior block verbatim; it covers ad-hoc work that never triggers a skill gate. No token-budget rule (the harness owns context)
