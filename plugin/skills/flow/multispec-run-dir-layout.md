# Multi-Spec run directory — per-spec config, slug convention, and `manifest.yml`

Read from `multi-spec.md`'s "Run directory layout" section (which keeps the anchoring rule and the tree diagram). This file carries the field-level detail.

The parent dir uses a single `spec-` prefix at the start of the slug segment so `find -name "*spec-${N}*"` reliably disambiguates record/spec IDs from timestamp digits.

**Each `spec-{N}/` carries its own `config.yml`** — a byte-for-byte copy of the parent's, written immediately before that spec's pipeline starts. Per-spec skills resolve levers via `resolve-policy.js --run "$PIPELINE_RUN_DIR"` where `PIPELINE_RUN_DIR` is the subdirectory — without its own `config.yml` that call resolves `source: default` and silently drops the Manifesto's answers for the whole spec. The step that writes it, its ordering rule, and the `#678`/`#925` history behind it are under "Scaffold the per-spec subdirectory" below.

`manifest.yml` lists the records in execution order plus their status as the run progresses — written exclusively through `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/hooks.js" spec-status` (see "Phase-progress banner and per-spec completion summary" below); nothing else writes this file. When `MULTISPEC_CURATION_DEFER=1` is set, it also carries `baseSha` — the shared worktree's starting commit (the value `worktree-setup.md`'s Step 0 captures as `EXPECTED_BASE` when the worktree is created, i.e. the commit before spec 1's materialize commit) — kept as diagnostic provenance (the batch's true starting commit). `multispec-batch-curation.md`'s registry pass no longer reads it as a diff base: its batch diff derives from `git merge-base` so boundary freshness merges (`multispec-freshness.md`) don't pollute the batch scope:

```

`phase` and `phases[]` (#1928) are written by every `spec-status` call — `phase` is the latest, `phases[]` is append-only (a re-entered phase adds another entry, never rewrites one). `bin/phase-timing.js` reads `phases[]` as the manifest-side boundary source for the run's Timing table; nothing else consumes it.
