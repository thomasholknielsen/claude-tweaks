# Materialization — Records to Build-Time Files

One shared procedure, referenced by both `/claude-tweaks:flow` and `/claude-tweaks:build` wherever either accepts a work record reference (`#N` / `#A,#B`) as input. It resolves the record, hard-gates on spec shape, and writes the one build-time file everything downstream (`/superpowers:writing-plans`, execution, verification, review) then treats exactly as it treated a spec file. This is the single definition of the materialized header — every consumer of `surface:`/`design-intent:`/`size:`/etc. reads it from here; nothing else restates the format.

**`bin/materialize.js <n> --run-dir <dir> [--repo owner/name] [--ceremony fast-lane|standard] [--multi-record-slug <n>]`** implements this file's resolution (`work-backend: github-issues`), the Materialization hard gate, header composition (`bin/lib/issues/materialize-format.js`), and the write, mechanically — `/flow`/`/build` invoke it for `github-issues` records instead of hand-composing the header inline per run. `--ceremony` is required only as a fallback when the record carries no `ceremony:*` label (the CLI cannot itself invoke the `assess-agent-autonomy` `ceremony-check` LLM judgment call below — the caller runs that first and passes the verdict through). `work-backend: local-files` is not yet wired into this CLI; that driver still reads inline per the procedure below.

**Freshness-stamp drift (#117).** When the record's body carries a `Verified-as-of: {sha}` line (written by the four health-sweep skills via `specShapedBody`'s `verifiedAsOf` param — a plain body-metadata line, same convention as `Surface:`/`Origin:`, never YAML frontmatter), the CLI computes the commit distance from that sha to this checkout's current `HEAD` and includes it in the JSON envelope as `drift: { sha, commits, ageDays, stale }` (`ageDays` is `null` when the stamped commit's date can't be read; `drift` itself is `null` when the record carries no stamp, or the stamped sha isn't reachable from `HEAD` in this checkout — e.g. a shallow clone). When `commits` crosses a threshold (`DRIFT_THRESHOLD_COMMITS`, currently 50), the CLI also prints an actionable line to stderr naming the commit distance and the stamped sha. The caller (`/flow`/`/build`) should surface this as a visible note — "premise is N commits old, re-derive before implementing" — never as a silent skip: a fresh stamp bounds drift, it does not establish correctness, so `[IL-71]`'s instruction to re-verify a filed body's facts stays in force regardless of what this says.

**Named-location drift (#315).** The stamp above bounds a premise's *age*; it says nothing about whether the locations the body *names* still exist, and `drift` is `null` for every record carrying no stamp — which is every record not filed by a health sweep. Before scoping an implementation to a file, function, or step the record's prose names, confirm that location still exists in this checkout (grep the named symbol, `ls` the named path), and treat the stated address as a hypothesis to verify rather than a fact to build on. Record bodies are never rewritten when a later refactor moves what they describe, and a relocation sweep reaches docs and skills but not the open backlog: #464 moved claim acquisition out of dispatch into `/flow`'s Step 2.8 and swept the stale "dispatch claims" attribution from README/docs, yet #315 — filed under the old model — still named "Dispatch's Step 4 claim path" as the fix site in seven places when it was finally built, and the first implementer scoped the fix to that stale module before a second dispatch corrected it.

## Resolution

Input is one or more record references: `#N` (single) or `#A,#B,...` (comma-joined, no spaces — mirrors the existing multi-spec-number convention). Resolve each record independently, the same way regardless of how many are in the batch.

> **Parallel execution:** Use parallel tool calls aggressively — resolving N record references (the `gh issue view` / local-store reads below) are independent per-record fetches and should run concurrently, the same way `multi-spec.md`'s "Frontmatter pre-flight" batches its own reads.

Read the project's `work-backend` config key (`_shared/work-record-config.md`, the key table's canonical home):

- **`work-backend: github-issues`** — `gh issue view {n} --json number,title,body,labels,url`. Derive `facets` from the returned `labels` via `parseRecordFacets` (`bin/lib/issues/record.js`).
- **`work-backend: local-files`** — glob `specs/{n}-*.md` for the matching filename, then `readRecord(path)` (`bin/lib/issues/local-store.js`). `facets` is already on the returned record (`.facets`).

This is the same fetch `/specify`'s Resolve-the-input case 1 uses for a record reference — deliberately identical, so a record looks the same to both skills.

### Record not found

A record reference that fails to resolve — `gh issue view {n}` errors (deleted issue, wrong repo, transposed digit) or no `specs/{n}-*.md` file matches under `work-backend: local-files` — is a hard stop, the same class of failure as the Materialization hard gate below: **STOP** before any worktree or run-dir work happens. Surface: `"Record #{n} could not be resolved (\`gh issue view {n}\` failed — check the issue exists in this repo)."` (or, under `local-files`, `"Record {n} could not be resolved — no specs/{n}-*.md file found."`). For a multi-record run, resolve every target before failing on any of them — report every unresolvable record in one message, not just the first one encountered, the same all-at-once reporting the Materialization hard gate already does for shape failures. This is a reachable path for direct human invocation (the Component-Skill Contract's "a human can also run it directly" case bypasses dispatch's own upstream existence check), not a theoretical one.

`fingerprint` — `extractFingerprint(body)` (`record.js`), run against the raw fetched body on either driver.

### Bare numeric input under `work-backend: local-files`

Under this driver, a local record's storage location *is* `specs/{n}-{slug}.md`. There is no separate GitHub issue to disambiguate against, so bare numeric input (no `#`) and `#`-prefixed input resolve identically, through this same local-files branch — reading the record file plus the shape gate below as a safety net. Under `work-backend: github-issues` a record reference always names a GitHub issue, whichever form is used.

## Materialization hard gate

Before composing anything, check the fetched body against `_shared/work-record.md`'s spec-shaped body definition: the sections `## Current State`, `## Deliverables`, and `## Acceptance Criteria` are present and each non-empty, and no unresolved placeholder marker (`TBD`, `TODO`, `<!-- ambiguity:`) remains anywhere in the body.

- **Passes** — proceed to header composition.
- **Fails** — STOP before any worktree or run-dir work happens: "Record #{n} is not spec-shaped ({missing/empty section list}) — run `/claude-tweaks:specify #{n}` first." For a multi-record run, gate every record before proceeding with any of them — report every failing record's gap in one message, not just the first one encountered.

This gate is the record-level replacement for `/flow`'s pre-flight design-doc rejection (Step 2.7) — see `SKILL.md` Steps 1-2. Step 2.7 still applies to path and topic input, where a design doc can still be named; this gate applies whenever a target is a record reference.

| Field | Named reader |
|---|---|
| `record` | `/wrap-up` close-via-merge carrier (`Fixes #{n}`) + Section E claim release |
| `origin` | `/wrap-up` summary/Review Console display (provenance line) |
| `risk` | Audit snapshot (preserved in the committed file; no active mechanical reader today) |
| `size` | `/build` size-based profile selection — caps at Capable (`low`→Fast / `medium`→Standard / `high`→Capable, `skills/build/SKILL.md` Common Step 2). Frontier is never derived from this field or any other header value — it is invocation-only, reachable solely via a `profile=frontier` token (or its `tier=frontier` alias) typed on the `/build`/`/flow` command line itself (SKILL.md's canonical guard). Consequently `profile=frontier` is never materialized into this header; the run dir's `frontier-tally.log` — not this file — carries Frontier cap state across the build's sequential dispatches, and survives interrupt/resume because the tally is append-only in the run dir. |
| `ceremony` | `/flow`'s Manifesto (Step 3) bundle-fold into the `ceremony-profile` lever |
| `grants` | Snapshot for audit; `/wrap-up`'s auto-merge check RE-READS LIVE LABELS before any merge (truth, not projection) |
| `fingerprint` | Audit snapshot / dedup cross-reference |
| `blocked-by` | `/flow`'s multi-spec dependency-aware ordering — DAG construction, cycle detection, and Prerequisites check (`multi-spec.md`) |
| `surface` | `/claude-tweaks:design-wrapper` wrapper Layer-2 detection (via /build Common Step 1.7 and /flow polish phase) |
| `design-intent` | design wrapper polish-mode intent-driven dispatch |
| `design-seed` | Audit snapshot of the Impeccable direction contract's seed key — a build's direction is unreproducible without it, since Impeccable 4.x is deliberately non-deterministic by dice. No mechanical reader consumes it at build time; `/claude-tweaks:demo` reads the record body's own `Design-seed:` line, not this copy |
| `parked-at-shaping` | `/wrap-up` Section E release-with-abandon restores `parked` |

`surface`/`design-intent`/`design-seed` values are LIFTED from the record body's `Surface:`/`Design-intent:`/`Design-seed:` metadata lines (spec 17's wire format). Materialized files live under the run dir — committed as audit trail, never gitignored.

**Reading a pre-rename header:** materialized files written before this field was renamed carry `effort:` where the format above now writes `size:`. Every reader treats an `effort:` line as `size` when no `size:` line is present — the same permanent read-side fallback `bin/lib/issues/record.js` and `bin/lib/issues/local-store.js` apply to the `effort:*` label and the `effort:` frontmatter line. The emit side is `size:`-only: nothing here ever writes an `effort:` line again.

## Populating the header

Every field except `surface`/`design-intent`/`design-seed` (next section) and `blocked-by` under `work-links: native` (one extra read — see its bullet below) comes straight off data already fetched during Resolution — nothing extra to read. `ceremony` is usually also free (`facets.ceremony`, from the label `/claude-tweaks:specify` already stamped) — see its own bullet below for the fallback case:

- `record` — the id used to resolve it.
- `origin` — `facets.origin` (the `by:*` label's suffix — see `_shared/work-record.md`'s Label taxonomy table for the members, stated once there), or the literal `human` when `facets.origin` is `null` (no `by:*` label — human-filed, or a side-effect record, per `_shared/work-record.md`'s origin axis).
- `risk` / `size` — `facets.risk` / `facets.size`; omit the line when the value is `null` (unscored).
- `grants` — `facets.grants.build` / `facets.grants.merge`, as the bracket list `[build, merge]` / `[build]` / `[]`. Unlike every other optional field here, always emit the `grants:` line, even empty — a record can reach materialization ungranted (a human running `/flow #{n}` directly against a record nobody authorized).
- `fingerprint` — from Resolution; omit the line when `null`.
- `blocked-by` — the record's dependency targets, driver/`work-links`-dependent: `work-backend: github-issues` + `work-links: body-text` — `parseDependencies(body)` (`bin/lib/issues/record.js`) over the already-fetched body, no extra read; `work-backend: github-issues` + `work-links: native` — one batched `gh api graphql` call across every record in the run (aliased per record number, reusing `buildNativeDependencyQuery`/`hasOpenNativeBlocker` from `bin/lib/issues/record.js` — the same pattern `/claude-tweaks:dispatch` Step 2 uses for its candidate pool), resolving `blockedBy` (the field `capabilities-probe.js`'s `probeSchema` checks for), added to Resolution. A single-record run is the degenerate one-alias case of the same call; `work-backend: local-files` — `facets.blockedBy`, already present on the read record. Emit as `blocked-by: [n1, n2, ...]`; omit the line when empty. Resolution is read-only and safe to run before any run dir or worktree exists (see "When this runs" below), so this data is available to `/flow`'s multi-spec pre-flight (`multi-spec.md`'s "Frontmatter pre-flight") immediately after Resolution — it does not need to wait for the header to be composed and written to disk.
- `parked-at-shaping` — `true` when the labels/facets fetched at materialization time still carry `parked`, omitted otherwise. `/specify` strips `parked` on promotion to `ready` (its permission-matrix row in `_shared/work-record.md`), so this is normally absent by the time a record is buildable; it stays meaningful for a record re-parked after promotion — e.g. by `/tidy`'s Defer action — that still got dispatched anyway, which is exactly the case `/wrap-up`'s restore-on-abandon step (see the reader table above) needs to detect.
- `ceremony` — `facets.ceremony` (the `ceremony:fast-lane`/`ceremony:standard` label `/claude-tweaks:specify` already stamped on every record it shapes). Always emit this line explicitly — never omit it, unlike every other optional field here. **Fallback only:** when `facets.ceremony` is `null` (the record reached `/flow` without ever going through `/specify`'s Step 3 — a hand-authored record, or one created before this behavior shipped), invoke the canonical ceremony-check pattern (`_shared/ceremony-check-invocation.md`) with `#{n}` using the same body/labels already fetched during Resolution. **This call site's delta:** fallback-only, per-record, with `#{n}`, and never writes back — use its `CEREMONY` output for this run's header only; `/specify` remains the sole owner of `ceremony:*`. Full rationale was `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-lifecycle-ceremony-tiering-design.md` (deleted `70849915`).

`surface` / `design-intent` / `design-seed` are the exceptions — via the lift rule below. `ceremony` is a partial exception, the same shape as `blocked-by`: free from Resolution's already-fetched facets in the common case, one extra invocation only in the fallback case above. `blocked-by` is a partial exception too: free under `work-links: body-text`/`local-files`, one extra read under `work-links: native` — see its bullet above.

## The Surface / Design-intent / Design-seed lift rule

`/specify`'s Metadata block (`spec-template.md`) writes plain body-metadata lines at the very top of every shaped record body:

```
Surface: {web | mobile | desktop | backend | infra | terminal}
Design-intent: {bold | quiet | minimal | delightful | onboarding | none}
Design-seed: {opaque token — never written by /specify; see below}
```

(`Design-intent:` is omitted on backend/infra records — Step 2.5a's frontend detection only asks the design-intent question for a frontend surface.) These are body text, not labels and not frontmatter — `parseRecordFacets`/`readRecord` never see them. Lift them verbatim by reading the fetched body's leading metadata block — every line before the first blank line, not a fixed line count, since which of these lines are present varies per record: the header's `surface:` copies the body's `Surface:` value; `design-intent:` copies `Design-intent:` when that line is present in the body, omitted from the header otherwise; `design-seed:` copies `Design-seed:` on the same present-or-omitted rule. Legacy `frontend` (pre-migration spec frontmatter) reads as `web`; `mixed` is retired — a record whose body still declares it needs re-shaping via `/specify` first, since a sub-issue that's genuinely both frontend and backend at once is a decomposition smell, not a valid surface value.

`Design-seed:` differs from its two neighbours in **when its value exists**, and materialization must not assume otherwise. `Surface:`/`Design-intent:` are written by `/specify`, so they are always already there by the time a record is materialized. `Design-seed:` is written *after* the build, by `/claude-tweaks:design-wrapper`'s `review` mode reading the built artifact's Impeccable direction contract (`_shared/design-contract.md`). Materialization runs at the *start* of a build — so on the very run that produces a seed, there is nothing to lift, and the header correctly omits the line. It appears in the header of *subsequent* materializations of the same record: a rebuild, a follow-up, a re-run after changes were requested. That is not a gap to work around; it is the field's normal lifecycle, and the header's copy is an audit snapshot either way.

Consequently, nothing may treat a missing `design-seed:` as an error or a reason to stop, and nothing may block waiting for it. The record body's own `Design-seed:` line — not this header copy — is what `/claude-tweaks:demo` reads at acceptance time, and it is read live from the record, so a first-build record whose header omits the line still shows its seed at `/demo`.

This is a lift, not a move: the body keeps its own `Surface:`/`Design-intent:`/`Design-seed:` lines exactly where they were written — see Composing the file below.

## Composing the file

```
---
{header fields from above}
---
# {n}: {title}

{record body verbatim}
```

`{title}` is the title fetched during Resolution (`gh issue view`'s `.title` field, or `readRecord(path).title`) — title is a record facet, never body content (`spec-template.md`'s Facets section), so it is not part of "record body verbatim" and needs this explicit heading line to stay visible to everything downstream that expects a spec file's first line to be its title. `{record body verbatim}` is exactly the fetched body, unmodified — including its own `Surface:`/`Design-intent:`/`Design-seed:` lines; the header's copies of those values are a lift, never a strip.

## Multi-record layout

Each record in a multi-record run (`#A,#B,...`) materializes to its own file, one per record — a partial materialization never happens silently; the hard gate above checks every record in the batch before any file is written.

Single-record and multi-spec runs use the two run-dir shapes already established by `_shared/pipeline-run-dir.md` and `multi-spec.md`:

```
{run-dir}/work/{n}-spec.md                       ← single-record run
{parent-run-dir}/spec-{a}/work/{a}-spec.md        ← multi-record run, record a
{parent-run-dir}/spec-{b}/work/{b}-spec.md        ← multi-record run, record b
```

The multi-record case reuses `multi-spec.md`'s `spec-{N}/` per-spec subdirectory, keyed by record id.

## When this runs

**Resolution and the hard gate are read-only** — safe to run at any point, including before a run directory or worktree exists. `/flow` runs them early (Step 1), performing the design-doc granularity check at the record level.

**Composing, writing, and committing the file needs a resolved `$PIPELINE_RUN_DIR` (`_shared/pipeline-run-dir.md`) and a checkout the write can land in.** The underlying constraint is real: a worktree branches from a commit, so anything merely left uncommitted in the tree it branched from does not travel with it. The remedy is to **create the worktree first, then scaffold the run dir and materialize inside it** — the file is written and committed on the feature branch, where it is already in the right place.

Do **not** write and commit the file on the current (pre-worktree) branch and then branch from that updated HEAD. That ordering is unexecutable on any project with `worktree-always: true`: the write lands in the main checkout, which the policy gate denies — `Write` first, and the `git commit` after it (see `_shared/policy-schema-coverage.md`'s `worktree-always` coverage block). There is no pipeline-bookkeeping exemption that covers it, because the run dir's *committed* half is ordinary tracked content on a branch, not the gitignored state the gate exempts. Worktree-first has no such problem and is correct under either policy, so it is the single documented order rather than a conditional one.

Sequence, in `worktree` mode (the default): create the worktree (`/build`'s Common Step 1, or `/flow`'s own up-front shared-worktree creation for a multi-record run). `{run-dir}` itself is never scaffolded inside the worktree — it is anchored at `$RUN_ROOT` per `_shared/pipeline-run-dir.md`'s Anchoring section (already created there by `/flow`'s own Step 3 Manifesto in the common case, or resolved via that file's Resolution order otherwise). Only `work/` is created — inside the worktree, at the matching relative path under the worktree's own filesystem location — then compose the file and commit it there as the branch's first commit.

In `current-branch` mode there is no worktree to order against — compose, write, and commit on the current branch directly. `worktree-always: true` and `current-branch` are mutually exclusive by construction, so this path never meets the gate.

Consumers that state this ordering: `build/SKILL.md` Common Step 1, `flow/SKILL.md` Step 4.2, and `flow/multi-spec.md`'s shared-worktree pre-flight. They cite this section rather than restating the rationale; if the order ever changes again, it changes here and those three citations follow.

**Standalone fallback (no run dir resolves).** When `/claude-tweaks:build #{n}` runs standalone — no `/claude-tweaks:flow` parent, and neither the `PIPELINE_RUN_DIR` env var nor a most-recent matching directory resolves per `_shared/pipeline-run-dir.md`'s Resolution order (steps 1-2) — create the standalone run dir's gitignored half (`decisions.md` + `staged/`, per `_shared/pipeline-run-dir.md`'s standalone conventions) at `$RUN_ROOT/.claude-tweaks/pipelines/{ISO-timestamp}-record-{n}-standalone/` (`$RUN_ROOT` resolved per that file's Anchoring section, not the current directory), and materialize `work/{n}-spec.md` into the **worktree's** copy of that same relative path — per the Anchoring section, `work/{n}-spec.md` is the tracked exception that stays in the worktree, not under `$RUN_ROOT`, and reaches the main checkout only by merge. This is narrower than that file's Resolution-order step 4 (the auto-mode standalone allowlist): it applies regardless of mode — materialization needs somewhere to write the file whether or not `auto` is active — and `/build` is not itself on that allowlist. (This same exception is now also its own numbered step 3 in `_shared/pipeline-run-dir.md`'s Resolution order, folded into that algorithm rather than trailing prose after it.) The resulting standalone run dir becomes this build's `$PIPELINE_RUN_DIR` for the rest of the run (ledger, decisions, and cleanup all resolve against it the same as any other run dir).

A record already materialized by a caller earlier in the same run (e.g. `/flow` wrote it before invoking `/claude-tweaks:build #{n}`) is not re-fetched or re-composed — the caller checks for an existing `{run-dir}/work/{n}-spec.md` (or its `spec-{N}/` equivalent) first and reads it in place when present.

## Committed as audit trail, never gitignored

Materialized files are meant to survive as ordinary tracked history on the branch that builds them. Unlike the rest of the pipeline run directory (`config.yml`, `decisions.md`, `staged/`, `run-state.json`, `events.jsonl` — all gitignored, archived as plain files at wrap-up, never committed; see `_shared/auto-mode-contract.md`), the `work/` subdirectory is a deliberate, narrow exception: `.gitignore` carves it out of the otherwise-blanket `.claude-tweaks/pipelines/` ignore so `git add`/`git commit` actually track it, at both the single-record depth (`{run-id}/work/`) and the multi-record depth (`{run-id}/spec-{N}/work/`).

Per this project's own convention for a committable child of an ignored parent (see CLAUDE.md's `.gitignore` guidance — a blanket ignore on a parent directory silently and permanently defeats a naive single-line `!` re-inclusion of anything nested under it), the fix does not rely on that pattern. It explicitly un-ignores each directory level on the way down to `work/`, at both nesting depths.
