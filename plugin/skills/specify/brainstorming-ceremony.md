# Brainstorming Ceremony — design-ceremony handoff

Cited by `SKILL.md`'s cases 1, 4, and 5 (case 5 reads "see case 1 for the
full procedure" and inherits this by that existing pointer, so it carries
no separate citation of its own). Before invoking `/superpowers:brainstorming`
at any of those three sites:

1. Resolve the policy value — no `--run` flag, the same timing
   `specify-auto-continue` (`_shared/policy-schema.md`) already uses,
   since brainstorming completes before any pipeline run directory exists:

   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-policy.js" design-ceremony
   ```

2. Write the exact text that would otherwise be passed as the Skill
   tool's `args` (case 1/5: the record's title + body; case 4: the bare
   topic string) to a temp file, then compose the actual `args` value:

   ```bash
   node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/compose-brainstorm-args.js" \
     --design-ceremony "{resolved value}" --input-file "{temp file path}"
   ```

3. Pass that command's stdout, verbatim, as the `/superpowers:brainstorming`
   Skill tool call's `args`.

On `fast-lane`, the composed `args` gains one prepended sentence asking
brainstorming's Architectural path to present its remaining design
sections as one consolidated block once the decision-carrying clarifying
questions are answered and the approach is chosen — brainstorming's own
final approval gate (its `Do NOT invoke any implementation skill... until
approved` HARD-GATE) is never removed by this instruction; it only
reduces how many times mid-design approval is asked, never whether. On
`standard` (the default) or any other value, the composed `args` is
byte-identical to the record's title+body or topic string alone.

## The "just go" ad-hoc convention

Independent of the `design-ceremony` policy default, a user may say "just
go" (or similar) mid-brainstorm to ask for the same section-consolidation
for that single session only — this already works today as ordinary
LLM-instruction-following inside `/superpowers:brainstorming` itself, and
needs no code change; it is documented here so it is discoverable rather
than something a user finds only by trial. It applies equally to a
`/superpowers:brainstorming` session started standalone, outside any of
`/specify`'s three call sites above — this file's Step 1-3 procedure is
`/specify`'s own way of reaching the same effect by policy default, not
the only way to reach it.
