# Browser Review Procedures

Shared procedures for every `/claude-tweaks:visual-review` mode that opens the browser. This
file holds what those modes need: prerequisites, mode resolution, QA enrichment,
reconnaissance, and the review contract they report against. The per-mode procedures live in
their own files — `page-mode.md`, `journey-mode.md`, and `discover-mode.md` in this skill's
directory — so a run loads only the mode it resolved to.

## Prerequisites

`agent-browser` must be installed. The daemon auto-starts on port 4848 with the first command. If `agent-browser` is unavailable, **stop** and report the missing dependency per `SKILL.md` Step 1 (Browser Prerequisites). Recovery on crash: `agent-browser doctor`.

Use the `/claude-tweaks:browse` skill's operation vocabulary and conventions for all browser operations throughout this document. Concrete commands live in `agent-browser-reference.md` in that skill's directory; `browse` is the single source of truth for the operation table.

### Session naming

Derive a kebab-case session name from the review target: `pricing-page-review`, `checkout-journey-review`, `discover-public-pages`. One session per page review or per journey walk.

### Screenshot path convention

All screenshots in this skill are annotated and written to:

```
.claude-tweaks/artifacts/screenshots/browse/<session>/<NN>_<description>.png
```

`<NN>` is a zero-padded sequence number per session (`01_landing`, `02_pricing`, ...). Annotated screenshots overlay numbered markers tied to the most recent `snapshot` refs — write findings using those overlay numbers, never spatial language like "the button on the right."

## Mode Resolution

`SKILL.md`'s own Modes table is canonical for the full mode list — it also covers
`recommendation` mode, which short-circuits in `SKILL.md` Step 0.5 without ever opening the
browser or reading this file. The browser-opening modes this file serves:

| Mode | Input | What happens |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Page mode** | URL or description | Review a single page or flow. Full creative framework applies. Vitals captured for the page. |
| **Journey mode** | `journey:{name}` | Walk a documented journey via a single `agent-browser batch` invocation. Each step is reviewed against its "should feel" / "red flags." Vitals captured per page. Overall arc assessed. |
| **Discover mode** | `discover` | Explore the running app to identify and document undocumented user journeys. Codebase scan + browser walkthrough. Vitals captured per discovered page. |

Page mode is for quick checks or pages that aren't part of a defined journey yet. Journey mode is the richer review — it has defined personas, goals, and experiential expectations at every step. Discover mode is for brownfield projects that need journey coverage bootstrapped.

### Dev URL Resolution

Run the canonical procedure in `dev-url-detection.md` in `skills/_shared/` — it probes `stories/servers.yml` (`servers.default.url`) first and falls back to detection heuristics. This eliminates the "Enter URL" prompt on subsequent runs when the dev server is running at the same address.

### Ensure the app is running

Before navigating, confirm the application is accessible. Dev URL resolution — including what to do when the URL doesn't respond — is handled by `SKILL.md` Step 2 (Dev URL Resolution) before this file's mode-specific procedures run; it covers both auto mode (ephemeral worktree server, pre-authorized) and interactive mode (`AskUserQuestion` offering to start the dev server, try a different URL, or wait — consent-gated). If a page open still fails mid-session after that resolution (e.g., the server died between steps), treat it as a health-check failure per Step 1: capture a trace, close the session, and report — don't re-prompt with a different option set than Step 2 already offered.

## QA Data Loading (optional enrichment)

Before starting the review steps, check whether QA data is available from a recent `/claude-tweaks:test qa` or `/claude-tweaks:test all` run. QA data enriches the structured review steps (Health Check, Analyze, Reimagine) but is not required — the full visual review works without it. Intuitive steps (First Impressions) are deliberately kept QA-free to preserve raw reactions.

> **Parallel execution:** Use parallel tool calls aggressively — all Glob and Read operations below are independent and should run concurrently.

1. **Find the latest QA run directory:** Glob for `.claude-tweaks/artifacts/screenshots/qa/*/report.json` and take the most recent by timestamp prefix.
2. **Read `report.json`:** Extract `page_inventories`, `caveats`, `findings`, and `stories` (for screenshot directories).
3. **Collect screenshots:** List screenshot files across story subdirectories in the QA run directory.

If no QA run directory or `report.json` exists, set `QA_DATA_AVAILABLE = false` and proceed — every QA integration point in the mode procedure that follows is skipped silently.

If QA data is found, set `QA_DATA_AVAILABLE = true` and store:
- `QA_PAGE_INVENTORIES` — structured page data (element counts, forms, navigation, accessibility, layout)
- `QA_CAVEATS` — observations from PASS_WITH_CAVEATS stories
- `QA_SCREENSHOTS` — paths to pre-captured screenshots
- `QA_FINDINGS` — classified findings from failures (code-bug, stale-selector, ux-issue, flaky-env, story-bug)

---


## QA-Accelerated Mode

When `QA_DATA_AVAILABLE = true`, the visual review shifts from comprehensive inspection to **verify + discover**. QA already performed mechanical checks (element counts, accessibility attributes, layout measurements, happy-path execution). The visual review focuses on what QA cannot assess: raw human reactions, visual feel, interaction quality, and creative ideas.

Steps 1, 3, and 4 have QA-accelerated variants that are shorter. Steps 2 (First Impressions) and 5 (Reimagine) run at full depth regardless — Step 2 captures raw reactions that must be QA-free, and Step 5 is judgment-based. Step 6 (Report & Route) is unchanged.

When `QA_DATA_AVAILABLE = false`, run all steps at full depth as documented in the resolved mode's own procedure file.

---


## Step 0: Reconnaissance

Before the structured review steps, understand what the page IS to generate contextual review perspectives instead of applying generic checklists.

Read `reconnaissance.md` in this skill's directory and run the full procedure. The output is a **Review Brief** containing: page classification (6 dimensions), selected review perspectives (6-10, trigger-scored), source code analysis (when accessible), and a central question framing the core tension.

Carry the Review Brief through all subsequent steps. Each step consults the brief's **Step Enrichment Map** for perspectives that inform that step's analysis.

**Gate:** If the page is broken or blank during reconnaissance browsing, abort and proceed directly to Step 1 (Health Check) — the health check will catch and report the failure.

**In journey mode:** Pass the journey's persona and goal to the reconnaissance procedure. These override the Audience and Auth dimension inference and weight perspective selection toward journey-relevant perspectives.

**In QA-accelerated mode:** Reconnaissance runs at full depth regardless — it is lightweight and classification quality does not depend on QA data.

---


## Journey Mode

When the resolved mode is `journey:{name}`, read `journey-mode.md` in this skill's directory for the full Journey Mode procedure (load journey → batch invocation → per-step review → arc assessment → journey-mode report → journey-file updates → trace-on-failure).

---


## Discover Mode

When the resolved mode is `discover`, read `discover-mode.md` in this skill's directory for the full Discover Mode procedure (codebase scan → journey candidates → browser walkthrough → write journey files → coverage report → handoff).

---


## Page Mode

When the resolved mode is a URL or description (no journey), read `page-mode.md` in this
skill's directory for the full Page Mode procedure (warm-up → health check → first
impressions → use it → analyze → reimagine → report).

---

## Shared review contract

Definitions every mode reports against. Page mode reaches them through its own Steps 1, 2,
and 6; journey and discover mode cite them directly. They live here rather than in
`page-mode.md` so a journey or discover run never loads the page-mode procedure to get them.

### Vitals interpretation (Step 1)

Read the vitals output captured during warm-up (or per-step in journey mode). Flag findings against these thresholds — they flow into the Step 6 findings table with **Source = Performance**:

| Metric | Threshold | Severity | What to flag |
|---|---|---|---|
| LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) | > 2.5s | Major | Slow primary content render — hero image, main heading, large text block |
| CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) | > 0.1 | Major | Layout jumping during load — unsized images, late-injected banners, font swaps |
| INP (Interaction to Next Paint) | > 200ms | Major | Sluggish interaction response — heavy event handlers, blocking JS |
| TTFB (Time to First Byte) | > 800ms | Minor | Slow server response — backend or CDN issue |
| FCP (First Contentful Paint) | > 1.8s | Minor | Slow paint of any content — render-blocking resources |

Report values verbatim under a **Performance** heading in the report (e.g., `LCP 3.1s, CLS 0.04, INP 180ms, TTFB 410ms, FCP 1.4s`). Even values within thresholds are worth recording — they become the baseline for future reviews.


---

### Step 2: First Impressions

> **Review Brief:** Apply the reconnaissance-selected perspectives mapped to Step 2. Answer the Central Question from your gut reaction.

This is the most important step. Before any structured analysis, just *look* and *react*.

#### The 5-second test

Look at the annotated screenshot for 5 seconds (no scrolling or extra clicking yet). Then answer:

- **What's the first thing your eye goes to?** Is that the right thing to notice first?
- **What's the overall feeling?** Cluttered? Clean? Sparse? Overwhelming? Inviting? Cold?
- **What's confusing?** Anything that makes you pause or wonder "what does this do?"
- **What's missing?** Not bugs — expectations. What did you expect to see that isn't there?
- **If you had to describe this page in one sentence to a friend, what would you say?**

Reference annotated overlay numbers when calling out specific elements (e.g., "element [7] dominates the visual weight even though it's a tertiary action").

#### Why this matters

Structured checklists catch known issue types. First impressions catch the things users *actually feel* — the vague sense that something's off, the moment of hesitation, the slight confusion. These reactions disappear once you start analyzing systematically, so capture them first.

> **Tone:** Be honest, not diplomatic. "This feels cluttered and I'm not sure where to look" is more useful than "layout could be improved." Write like you're texting a colleague, not filing a bug report.

---

### Step 6: Report & Route

Present findings from the review in a single structure that serves as both the report and the routing table.

#### Header

```markdown
## Visual Review: {page/feature description}

**URL:** {url}
**Session:** {session name}
**Classification:** {Type} | {Auth} | {Stage} | {Data} | {Complexity} | {Audience}
**Central Question:** {The central question from the Review Brief}
**Health:** {functional / N console errors / N failed requests / broken}
**Performance:** LCP {value} | CLS {value} | INP {value} | TTFB {value} | FCP {value}
**First Impression:** {The honest 5-second reaction in 1-2 sentences. Keep the raw tone.}
**Interaction Feel:** Speed: {snappy/acceptable/sluggish} | Feedback: {clear/inconsistent/missing} | Transitions: {smooth/janky/none}
**Screenshots:** {paths under .claude-tweaks/artifacts/screenshots/browse/<session>/}
**Trace (if failure):** {path under .claude-tweaks/artifacts/traces/<session>/ — omit if no failure}
**QA context:** {QA run dir, stories covering this page, QA status — or "No QA data"}
```

**Strengths** (before the findings table): When something is genuinely good, note it in one sentence: "Strengths: {1-2 specific things that work well and should be preserved}." Do not create a separate section — this anchors what to protect while fixing issues.

#### Findings & Ideas

Present all findings and ideas in a single batch table. Findings reference annotated overlay numbers from the screenshots:

```
| # | Finding | Type | Source | Severity/Impact | Recommended |
|---|---------|------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | {description with overlay refs e.g. "element [3] competes with [5]"} | Issue | Health | Critical | Fix now |
| 2 | LCP 3.1s exceeds 2.5s threshold | Issue | Performance | Major | Fix now |
| 3 | CLS 0.18 — hero image lacks dimensions | Issue | Performance | Major | Fix now |
| 4 | {description} | Issue | Analyze | Minor | Fix now |
| 5 | {description} | Issue | Persona | Cosmetic | Fix now |
| 6 | {description} | Idea | Reimagine | High | Fix now — add to current spec |
| 7 | {description} | Idea | Reimagine | Medium | Defer — not relevant now |
| 8 | {description} | Idea | Reimagine | Low | Capture — needs brainstorming |
```

The table renders as markdown, as above. Immediately below it, call `AskUserQuestion` with:

- `question`: `"How do you want to handle these findings?"`, `header`: `"Findings"`, `multiSelect`: `false`
- Option 1 — `label`: `"Apply all (Recommended)"`, `description`: `"Apply all recommendations"`
- Option 2 — `label`: `"Override specific items"`, `description`: `"tell me which #s to change"`

**Hard gate.** Check the response you are about to send: does it already contain the Findings & Ideas table above as literal rendered markdown, with a row for every finding? If not, render it now, in this response, before the tool call — "Apply all" with no table above it leaves the user approving an unnamed set of UI findings.

The **Source** column traces each finding to its origin step (Health, Performance, First Impression, Persona, Analyze, Reimagine). This replaces the separate "Functional Issues," "Visual & Content Issues," and "UX Observations" report sections.

**Recommendation rules for Issues:**
- **All severities** — default "Fix now." Close the gap now.
- **Defer** (new work record — born-ready, or `parked` on a concrete wake condition) — the fix is understood but bigger and not relevant to the current work. Gated by `_shared/deferral-gate.md` (fix-now first; a valid `Defer-reason:` or the item stays open). Compose via `specShapedBody` exactly as review Step 3's Defer does (`review/step3-routing.md`), with `filedBy: 'visual review'`, `provenance: { origin: 'visual review', deferReason }` and footer `_Filed by \`visual review\` via specShapedBody._`, then create it via the unified record contract (`_shared/work-record.md`). Before creating the record, apply `_shared/materiality-floor.md`'s floor test: an item that fails to clear the materiality floor, with a non-`tangential` `Defer-reason:`, shows "Digest — below floor" in the Recommended column instead, and only writes the digest entry once the human approves that row (or an auto path applies it).
- **Capture** — the issue is complex or uncertain and needs brainstorming/exploration before it can be acted on. Invoke `/claude-tweaks:capture` with the shaped body and `--defer-reason={value} --source visual-review` (capture's Shaped-body branch — `capture/SKILL.md`), plus `--needs-definition` when it names an open choice. This branch is subject to `_shared/materiality-floor.md`'s floor test like any other filing branch: `Defer-reason: tangential` always clears the materiality floor per that contract's Overrides section, but a different reason applies the ordinary test before invoking capture, same as the Issues Defer bullet above.
- **"Accept as-is"** — only for intentional design choices. If it's a genuine defect, fix it or route it.

**Recommendation rules for Ideas:**
- **Fix now** — the strong default. If the idea can be implemented in the current session, do it. Add to the current spec scope if applicable.
- **Defer** (new work record, `parked`) — the idea is clear but bigger and not relevant to the current work. Same gate and composition as the Issues Defer above (`_shared/deferral-gate.md`; an idea is by nature `tangential` unless it blocks on something concrete — a concrete wake condition makes it `parked` with a `Trigger:` header). Since an Ideas-Defer item is `tangential` by default, `_shared/materiality-floor.md`'s override clears the materiality floor for the common case; only the less-common `parked`-with-Trigger path (a non-`tangential` reason) is ever eligible for "Digest — below floor" in the Recommended column, following the same before-render check as the Issues Defer bullet above.
- **Capture** — the idea is complex or uncertain and needs brainstorming/exploration before it can be acted on. Invoke `/claude-tweaks:capture` with the shaped body and `--defer-reason={value} --source visual-review` (capture's Shaped-body branch — `capture/SKILL.md`), plus `--needs-definition` when it names an open choice (an idea's usual reason is `tangential`, which always clears the materiality floor per `_shared/materiality-floor.md`'s Overrides section; a non-`tangential` Capture-routed idea, the rarer case, is still subject to the ordinary floor test before invoking capture, same as the Ideas Defer bullet above).

> **Routing bias:** Fix it now — always the recommended default. Defer when the fix is bigger and not relevant now. Capture when the issue/idea needs exploration. Cosmetic issues accumulate into a feeling of low quality — fix them while they're fresh.

Group related cosmetic issues into a single row rather than listing each individually. Every idea goes to a durable destination. "Note for later" without a destination means "lose forever."

#### Verdict

After the findings table:
- **CLEAN** — No significant issues. Ideas are enhancements, not fixes.
- **ISSUES FOUND** — {count} issues need attention.
- **BROKEN** — Page is non-functional. (Trace path attached above.)

#### Creative Opportunities (survey integration)

After the verdict, the parent `SKILL.md` Step 4 invokes `/claude-tweaks:design-wrapper survey` with the captured screenshot paths and renders a Creative Opportunities block from the wrapper's recommendations. The block is appended verbatim to this report — it lives below the verdict and above Next Actions.

The survey block is a separate concern from the findings table: the findings table catalogs issues and idea routing; the Creative Opportunities block surfaces ranked Impeccable command suggestions per the survey "would help" criteria → command mapping in `design-wrapper/command-map.md` (the single source of truth for that set). Recommendations are never auto-applied — the user runs any command manually if it resonates.

When the survey wrapper returns no recommendations or a skip (non-frontend, Impeccable not installed, integration disabled), omit the block entirely. Do not surface "no creative opportunities found" as a positive signal — survey is heuristic and an empty result means "nothing matched the criteria," not "design is complete."

See `SKILL.md` Step 4 for the exact template, return-shape handling, and the suppression-note convention when the wrapper reports `suppressed > 0`.

#### Next Actions

This mode-specific table supplements the canonical handoff in SKILL.md `## Next Actions` — "supplements" here means *substitutes when more specific*, not *merges line sets*. This section renders its own independent markdown block, resolved dynamically from the signal table below exactly as `design/SKILL.md`'s Return-shape table resolves — render it (with its own lines, including `/claude-tweaks:wrap-up {N}`, which is not one of SKILL.md's 4 static lines) when the review-source signals (full review mode, missing code review, "fix now" items, standalone) usefully refine the standalone block. It renders *instead of* SKILL.md's canonical Next Actions block, never alongside or merged with it. When in doubt, defer to SKILL.md `## Next Actions`.

The signal-to-option lookup table below stays as-is — the assistant's own logic for picking which options apply this run, never itself shown to the user:

| Signal | Option |
|--------|--------|
| Coming from full review mode | `/claude-tweaks:wrap-up {N}` — capture learnings and clean up |
| Not yet code-reviewed | `/claude-tweaks:review {N}` — run code review before wrapping up |
| "Fix now" items exist | Address fixes first, then re-run this review |
| Standalone | `/claude-tweaks:capture` — save ideas surfaced during the session |

Once the signals are resolved, render as plain markdown (docs/skill-authoring.md's Skill handoffs convention):

**`/claude-tweaks:wrap-up {N}`** — capture learnings and clean up (recommended) — when coming from full review mode
`/claude-tweaks:review {N}` — run code review before wrapping up — when not yet code-reviewed
Address fixes first, then re-run this review — when "fix now" items exist
`/claude-tweaks:capture` — save ideas surfaced during the session — standalone

---


## Important Notes

- This review requires `agent-browser` — install with `npm install -g agent-browser` if missing
- Snapshots are ephemeral; annotated screenshots and traces are persistent — findings reference overlay numbers and screenshot/trace paths
- Every reviewed page produces vitals — Web Vitals are a first-class finding category, never skip the `vitals` op
- Always use annotated screenshots — bare screenshots lose the overlay numbering that makes findings precise
- Journey walks use a single `batch` invocation per session lifecycle slice — never spread a journey across many one-off invocations
- When a step fails, save the trace first (`trace stop <path>` — recording must have been started at session open via `trace start`), then `close` — failure reports without a trace path are not actionable
- The review is scoped to the current work — don't review the entire application (except in journey mode, where the full journey is in scope, and discover mode, which scans the whole app)
- Journey mode auto-detects when invoked with no arguments by checking `docs/journeys/` against recent changes
- Journey files are living documents — update them when visual review reveals gaps or inaccuracies
- Console errors and network failures are often the fastest signal — check them in the snapshot output during health check
- Resize testing is optional and should be skipped unless layout changes are in scope; use `set viewport` rather than env vars
- The step order matters: reconnaissance → reaction → experience → analysis → imagination. Don't rearrange.
- Reconnaissance (Step 0) is a fast pre-step — it classifies and moves on. The review steps are where depth happens. If reconnaissance takes more than 60 seconds, something is wrong.
