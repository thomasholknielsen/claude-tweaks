# Dispatch Step 3 — This Firing's Re-selection Guard

Referenced by `skills/dispatch/SKILL.md` Step 3's Loop. A prior version of that loop assumed
"claimed/Settle-failed groups drop out automatically, via claim or `bot:blocked`" — false for two
real terminal shapes, both leaving a group's labels exactly as eligible as before the attempt:

- A claim-contest/in-flight pre-flight stop (`settle-and-merge.md`'s Claim-contest special case
  explicitly adds neither label, since there was nothing to release or classify).
- An ordinary build/test failure before `dispatch-retry-ceiling` is reached — the record keeps
  `auto:build` for up to two more genuine retries by design.

Without an explicit guard, the very next iteration of the *same* firing re-ranks the identical
group back to the top and reproduces the identical stop, burning the remaining budget on one stuck
record instead of reaching other eligible candidates.

## The rule

After each iteration, append that group's member issue number(s) to this run's session-scoped
`dispatch-firing-excluded.json` (`_shared/session-tmp-root.md`; create it with `[]` first if this
is the first append) whenever this firing's attempt on that group did **not** end in a live-held or
resolved disposition:

- The first call's status line was not `DONE`/`DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`, or its `OUTCOME` was not
  `build-test-ok` (second call never dispatched) — append now.
- The second call's `OUTCOME` was `failed`/`blocked` — Settle already released the claim, so the
  label-based pre-filter would let the group right back in — append now.

Do **not** append on `merged`/`armed`/`pending-review`/`ready-to-merge`: those hold a live claim
(`bot:in-progress`) or are already resolved, so the ordinary claim/label mechanism already excludes
them from the next queue pull. Appending there would be redundant, not wrong — but the point of
this file is the two shapes that mechanism misses.

`next-ranking.md`'s script reads this file (absent treated as `[]`) and excludes any matching group
from the candidate pool, the same way it already excludes an oversized group. `next`'s
single-iteration alias never reads or writes this file — there is no second iteration in the same
firing for it to protect.
