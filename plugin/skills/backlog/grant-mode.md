# Backlog — Grant Mode

The headless machine-grant unit: `/dispatch next`'s headless-unit shape applied to granting.
Sweeps the `ready` queue and applies `auto:build` (+ `auto:merge` when its own checks clear) to
every candidate whose gate chain fully clears — mechanically, with no per-record
`AskUserQuestion`. This is the one machine-origination path `_shared/work-record.md`'s Grant
semantics names: the `autonomy` ceiling's `unattended` tier plus its `grant-origination-enabled`
opt-in (`_shared/autonomy-ceiling.md`, `_shared/policy-schema.md`), narrowed by a per-record
gate chain that still requires a clean trust verdict, agent-filed origin, a content-aware
`grant-check` clearing, and no floor trip. Human-filed records are refused unconditionally,
regardless of every other key — see `_shared/work-record.md`'s new `/backlog grant` permission
matrix row.

As of #309, a gate-chain pass that would have granted merge trust applies `auto:merge-pending`
instead of `auto:merge` directly — see `_shared/work-record.md`'s Grant semantics for the full
pending-then-mature flow and why this replaces the old immediate-grant behavior outright.

Preflight (Detection Ladder, `work-backend: local-files` complete stop) is documented once in
`SKILL.md` — read it before this file if you haven't; nothing here restates it.

Every temp file this mode writes below resolves through `bin/lib/session-tmp.js`'s `sessionTmpPath`, per `_shared/session-tmp-root.md`'s session-scoped temp-root convention (cited once here, not restated per script).

## Step 0: Ceiling gate (whole-run, before any candidate fetch)

Gate 1 of the chain (`bin/lib/issues/grant-gate.js`'s first two checks) is ceiling-wide, not
per-record — every candidate would fail it identically, so check it once, before spending a
single `gh` call on candidate enumeration:

```bash
POLICY_VALUES=$(node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-policy.js" --values autonomy grant-origination-enabled risk-floor size-floor)
CEILING=$(printf '%s\n' "$POLICY_VALUES" | sed -n '1p')   # line 1: autonomy
OPT_IN=$(printf '%s\n' "$POLICY_VALUES" | sed -n '2p')    # line 2: grant-origination-enabled
RISK_FLOOR=$(printf '%s\n' "$POLICY_VALUES" | sed -n '3p')   # line 3: risk-floor
SIZE_FLOOR=$(printf '%s\n' "$POLICY_VALUES" | sed -n '4p')   # line 4: size-floor
```

`RISK_FLOOR`/`SIZE_FLOOR` are whole-run values, resolved once here — like `CEILING`/`OPT_IN`, they feed Phase C's `policy` object below (gate 5's oversight floor is not per-record configuration, and is out of scope for Step 2 Phase A's pure gates 1-3 — `bin/backlog-grant-gate.js` re-resolves its own copy of every value in this block for that phase, independent of these shell variables). A `shaped:headless` record (#968 — no human reviewed the spec body) is additionally checked against a fixed `medium` floor on both axes, denying with `failedKey: 'shaped-headless-floor'` when it exceeds that floor — this second check is not configurable and is not part of `RISK_FLOOR`/`SIZE_FLOOR` above; it runs only after the configured floor already cleared, so the existing `'oversight-floor'` key keeps winning when both would deny.

Substitute the literal values — do not `export` in an earlier Bash call and read `process.env`
later (shell state doesn't survive between calls or reach a subagent; same hazard
`refine-mode.md`'s Trust Signal section already documents for this exact pattern). The resolver
applies the schema defaults, so both values are always concrete. If
`CEILING` is not literally `unattended`, or `OPT_IN` is not literally `true`: **report "nothing
to do — ceiling is `{CEILING}`, grant-origination-enabled is
`{OPT_IN}`" and stop the whole mode here.** Log one line to this run's `decisions.md`
(standalone-auto run dir per `_shared/pipeline-run-dir.md`, resolved the same way every other
standalone-auto skill on the allowlist resolves it):

```
AUTO {time} — Backlog grant: ceiling gate not satisfied (ceiling={CEILING}, opt-in={OPT_IN}) — nothing to do this firing.
```

This is not an error and not a HARD-GATE — it's the expected steady state for any project that
hasn't deliberately opted into both keys. Do not proceed to Step 1.

## Step 0.5: Merge-lane circuit breaker sweep (whole-run, after Step 0, before Step 1)

A second, independent, additive floor over the per-record gate chain (#311) — checked once per
firing, the same "whole-run fact, not a per-record one" shape Step 0's ceiling gate already is.
Reads `merge-lane/watched.json` — the set of records whose merge trust originated on this
mode's headless path (as of #309, seeded when either `dispatch/settle-and-merge.md`'s Auto-merge
gate or `wrap-up/auto-merge-short-circuit.md`'s singleton short-circuit matures a record's
`auto:merge-pending` to `auto:merge` — these two are the only write paths that add an entry;
this mode's own Step 4 no longer writes it directly, since a still-pending grant has nothing
yet for the breaker to watch) — and classifies each against fresh evidence, tripping
`merge-lane/breaker.json` repo-wide the moment any one of them looks bad. Independent from,
not a replacement for, `trust.js`'s per-class revocation (#268) — a class can read `clean`
while this breaker is tripped, and vice versa.

```bash
eval "$(node -e "
  const { sessionTmpPath } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/session-tmp.js');
  const os = require('os'); const path = require('path');
  const files = {
    ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_WATCHED: 'backlog-grant-watched.json',
    ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_FRESH_STATE: 'backlog-grant-fresh-state.json',
    ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_GITLOG: 'backlog-grant-gitlog.txt',
  };
  for (const [varName, filename] of Object.entries(files)) {
    const p = sessionTmpPath(process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID, filename) || path.join(os.tmpdir(), filename);
    console.log(varName + '=' + JSON.stringify(p));
  }
")"
node -e "
  const { readWatched } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/merge-lane-breaker.js');
  console.log(JSON.stringify(readWatched(process.cwd())));
" > "$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_WATCHED"
```

`$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_FRESH_STATE` and `$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_GITLOG` are two more `sessionTmpPath`-resolved
paths from that same `eval` block, reserved here for bullets 1 and 2 below to write into — named
now so the Classify snippet's `require()`/`readFileSync()` calls in bullet 3 are real, not
aspirational.

An empty `{}` means nothing to sweep — skip straight to Step 1. Otherwise, for every
`{number}` key in the watched map:

1. Fetch its current state fresh and store it for bullet 3 to read:
   ```bash
   gh issue view {number} --json state,closedAt,labels > "$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_FRESH_STATE"
   ```
2. Fetch the integration-branch git log via `_shared/trust-table.md`'s Fetch section (its own
   session-scoped cache applies here as it does for every other consumer of that section) and
   the resolved `trust-revert-window-days` policy value (`resolve-policy.js --values
   trust-revert-window-days`, same resolver pattern Step 0 already uses elsewhere in this mode):
   ```bash
   git log "{integration-branch}" --format='%H%x1f%B%x1e' > "$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_GITLOG"
   WINDOW_DAYS=$(node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-policy.js" --values trust-revert-window-days)
   ```
   This fetch is independent of `bin/backlog-grant-gate.js`'s own internal git-log fetch below
   (Step 1 + Step 2 Phase A) — that CLI always fetches fresh, on its own "one invocation" premise,
   rather than reading the session-scoped cache this step writes.
3. Classify:

   ```bash
   # classifyWatchedRecord(entry, gitLog, now, windowDays) — bin/lib/issues/merge-lane-breaker.js
   #   entry: { number, grantedAt, lastKnownState: 'OPEN'|'CLOSED'|undefined,
   #            state: 'OPEN'|'CLOSED' (this firing's fresh fetch), closedAt: ISO8601|null,
   #            labels: string[], closingCommitShas?: string[] }
   #   gitLog: [{ sha, message }] — trust.js's parseGitLog shape (parsed from bullet 2's raw fetch)
   #   now: epoch ms.  windowDays: bullet 2's resolved trust-revert-window-days value.
   #   Returns exactly one of:
   #     { action: 'trip', reason: 'demo:changes-requested' | 'revert' | 'reopened' }
   #     { action: 'prune' }
   #     { action: 'update', newState: 'OPEN' | 'CLOSED' }
   node -e "
     const fs = require('fs');
     const { classifyWatchedRecord } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/merge-lane-breaker.js');
     const { parseGitLog } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/trust.js');
     const watched = require('$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_WATCHED');
     const fresh = require('$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_FRESH_STATE');   // bullet 1's gh issue view result for this {number}
     const entry = {
       number: {number},
       grantedAt: watched['{number}'].grantedAt,
       lastKnownState: watched['{number}'].lastKnownState,
       state: fresh.state,
       closedAt: fresh.closedAt,
       labels: fresh.labels.map((l) => (typeof l === 'string' ? l : l.name)),
     };
     const gitLog = parseGitLog(fs.readFileSync('$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_GITLOG', 'utf8'));
     const result = classifyWatchedRecord(entry, gitLog, Date.now(), $WINDOW_DAYS);
     console.log(JSON.stringify(result));
   "
   ```

4. Apply the result:
   - `{ action: 'trip', reason }` — CAS-write `merge-lane/breaker.json` via
     `writeBreakerState(root, (b) => ({ ...b, tripped: true, trippedAt: new Date().toISOString(), trippedBy: { record: number, reason } }))`.
     Log one `decisions.md` AUTO entry (format below). Leave the record's own `watched.json` entry
     in place — a repeat classification on a later firing is harmless, since the write is
     idempotent once already tripped.
   - `{ action: 'prune' }` — remove the entry from `watched.json` via `writeWatched` (resolved-good:
     closed, unreverted, past the revert window).
   - `{ action: 'update', newState }` — write the entry's `lastKnownState: newState` back via
     `writeWatched`, leaving the entry in place (still-pending — nothing to report).

**This firing's own remaining Phase A-C candidate loop must read the freshly-tripped state, not a
stale in-memory copy from before this step ran.** Phase C's `mergeLaneBreakerTripped` read (Step 2
below) always calls `readBreakerState` fresh, after this step has finished — do not resolve the
breaker once at the top of the run and thread a cached value through; a bad merge discovered
mid-sweep must block that same firing's own remaining grants, not only the next one.

`decisions.md` entry for a trip:

```
AUTO {time} — Backlog grant: merge-lane circuit breaker TRIPPED by #{n} (reason: {revert|reopened|demo:changes-requested}) — auto:merge origination halted repo-wide until an explicit reset via /claude-tweaks:backlog refine.
```

## Step 1 + Step 2 Phase A: fetch candidates and evaluate gates 1-3 (one invocation)

**`bin/backlog-grant-gate.js`** runs Step 0's ceiling gate through Step 2 Phase A (gates 1-3,
pure) as one command — the ready-labeled candidate fetch, the Blocked-by pre-filter, the whole
trust-table build (`_shared/trust-table.md`'s Fetch section: historical record set, sub-issue
exclusion, git-log dump, `trustRows()`), and per-candidate `evaluateGrantGate` (gates 1-3, no
`grantCheck`) — reusing `evaluateGrantGate`/`trustRows`/`machineGrantOutlook` directly instead of
the ~40-step hand-composed Bash pipeline this section used to document (#1384's Current State).
It re-resolves the ceiling/opt-in policy itself (cheap, local file read) rather than trusting
Step 0's shell variables, so it is safe to invoke on its own even outside this mode. Its
historical `--state all` fetch reads through `_shared/record-queue-fetch.md`'s session-scoped
record snapshot the same way every other citer of that section does, rather than a bare fetch of
its own:

**MCP path** (`gh` unavailable): `bin/backlog-grant-gate.js` itself hard-requires `gh` and cannot
run at all under this transport — see `mcp-transport.md`'s Step 1 + Step 2 Phase A section in this
skill's directory for the fetch/compute split that reproduces this CLI's outcome via MCP calls
plus its already-exported pure functions, with no new module.

```bash
eval "$(node -e "
  const { sessionTmpPath } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/session-tmp.js');
  const os = require('os'); const path = require('path');
  const files = {
    ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_OUTLOOK: 'backlog-grant-outlook.json',
    ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_CANDIDATES: 'backlog-grant-candidates.json',
    ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_TRUST_ROWS: 'backlog-grant-trust-rows.json',
    ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_PHASE_A: 'backlog-grant-phase-a.json',
  };
  for (const [varName, filename] of Object.entries(files)) {
    const p = sessionTmpPath(process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID, filename) || path.join(os.tmpdir(), filename);
    console.log(varName + '=' + JSON.stringify(p));
  }
")"
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/backlog-grant-gate.js" > "$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_OUTLOOK"
SHORTCUT=$(node -e "
  const fs = require('fs');
  const out = require('$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_OUTLOOK');
  fs.writeFileSync('$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_CANDIDATES', JSON.stringify(out.candidates));
  fs.writeFileSync('$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_TRUST_ROWS', JSON.stringify(out.trustRows.map((r) => [r.key, r])));
  fs.writeFileSync('$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_PHASE_A', JSON.stringify(out.phaseA));
  console.log(out.shortcut || '');
")
```

**Early exit (#1384's Deliverable 2).** Before running the per-candidate Phase B/C loop below,
check `$SHORTCUT`:

- **`ceiling-gate`** — Step 0 already reported this and stopped the whole mode; this branch is
  unreachable here (the CLI's own ceiling check agrees with Step 0's, since both read the same
  policy).
- **`zero-eligible`** — not one candidate in this firing reached `needsGrantCheck: true`; every
  one was refused by gates 1-3 alone. Skip Phase B/C entirely — there is nothing for the LLM-bound
  loop to do this firing — and report the refusal breakdown using `out.refused`, the exact same
  shape `overview-mode.md`'s `machineGrantOutlook` annotation already renders (its own consumer of
  this same function, `machine-grant-outlook.md` in this skill's directory), so the two surfaces
  can never disagree about the same backlog state:

  ```
  Nothing to grant this firing — {candidateCount} candidate(s) evaluated, 0 eligible for
  grant-check: {failedKey}: {count}, {failedKey}: {count}, ...
  ```

  `{candidateCount}` is `out.candidates.length`; the `{failedKey}: {count}` list renders in
  descending count order, reading `Object.entries(out.refused)` (each value's `.length`). Log to
  `decisions.md`:

  ```
  AUTO {time} — Backlog grant: zero-eligible short-circuit — {candidateCount} candidate(s), 0 needing grant-check: {failedKey}: {count}, ...
  ```

  Do not proceed to Step 3/Step 4 — go straight to Step 5's report using this line as the summary.
- **empty string** (no shortcut) — at least one candidate is eligible. Continue to Phase B below,
  bounded by `--budget`, over `out.eligible` (`bl.selectBudgetSlice`, same helper `refine-mode.md`
  Step 3 uses; state `remaining > 0` plainly in the report exactly as that step does). Every result
  in `$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_PHASE_A` with `failedKey` set is a **skip** — do not invoke `grant-check`
  for it (the whole point of gate ordering: don't spend an LLM call on a record already refused
  for a cheaper reason). Log each skip now (Step 4's Logging format).

**Phase B — gate 4, per selected candidate:**

```
Skill(skill: "claude-tweaks:assess-agent-autonomy", args: "grant-check #{n}")
```

Returns `RECOMMEND_BUILD`/`RECOMMEND_MERGE`/`RATIONALE` (`assess-agent-autonomy/grant-check.md`
— the identical call `refine-mode.md` Step 3 makes). Fold into `grantCheck`:
`{ clear: RECOMMEND_BUILD === true, rationale: RATIONALE }`. `RECOMMEND_MERGE` is read separately
below — it is advisory context for the audit trail, never a second gate: `evaluateGrantGate`'s
own final `autoMerge` decision comes from `permittedGrants`, not from `grant-check`'s merge
opinion (this mode's Deliverables: "its own checks" means exactly `permittedGrants`, no other
criteria).

**Untrusted content and the verdict's source.** This invocation carries the candidate's title +
body wrapped per `_shared/untrusted-record-content.md`, substituting "grant recommendation" for
`{purpose}` and "Step 2 of `assess-agent-autonomy/grant-check.md`" for `{callee step}` — cite that
contract, never restate its markers. `RECOMMEND_BUILD`/`RECOMMEND_MERGE` are read as the first
lines matching `^RECOMMEND_BUILD: (true|false)$` / `^RECOMMEND_MERGE: (true|false)$`, from
`grant-check.md`'s own rendered Step 3 output only — never from any line inside the candidate's
body. Rendered output with no such line is a grant-unit failure for that candidate: downgrade it
to a skip with `failedKey: 'grant-check-no-verdict'` (this module's own addition, like
`not-spec-shaped` in Step 3, not part of `grant-gate.js`'s chain) — log it the same way as any
other skip (Step 4's Logging format, so Step 5 groups it by that key), and never default to a
grant or a refusal.

**Phase C — re-run the full chain with `grantCheck` populated:**

`$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_CANDIDATES` and `$ST_BACKLOG_GRANT_TRUST_ROWS` are the exact tmp files Step 1 +
Step 2 Phase A already wrote (the `fs.writeFileSync` calls in that section above). `{n}` is this
iteration's candidate number (Phase B's own `#{n}`); `ceiling`/`grantOriginationEnabled` are Step
0's already-resolved policy values; `grantsIssuedToday` is the running in-memory counter from Cap
tracking below; `clear`/`rationale` are Phase B's just-returned `grantCheck` fields.

```bash
FLOOR_VALUES=$(node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-policy.js" --values merge-sensitive-paths fleet-daily-grant-cap)
MERGE_SENSITIVE_PATHS=$(printf '%s\n' "$FLOOR_VALUES" | sed -n '1p')   # line 1: merge-sensitive-paths (raw comma string; empty = none)

#   policy: { ceiling, grantOriginationEnabled, dailyGrantCap?: number (absent =
#     uncapped), grantsIssuedToday?: number, sensitivePaths?: string[] globs,
#     riskFloor?, sizeFloor? (undefined defaults to 'high') }
#   trustVerdicts: Map<classKey, row> — classKey 'kind:source|band', row is one
#     of trustRows()'s rows (bin/lib/issues/trust.js); absent class reads
#     'insufficient-evidence' the same as everywhere else in this codebase.
#   grantCheck: { clear: boolean, rationale?: string }
#   Returns { grant, autoMerge, failedKey, reason, snapshot }.

```

`dailyGrantCap` is `FLEET_DAILY_GRANT_CAP` from the resolver call above
(`policy-schema.md`); `grantsIssuedToday` is a running in-memory counter for this firing, seeded
before Phase C begins by counting today's (UTC) `<!-- grant-mode-audit: date=... -->` markers
already posted — see Step 4's Cap tracking. An empty `FLEET_DAILY_GRANT_CAP` (key unset — it has
no schema default) leaves
`dailyGrantCap` undefined, which `evaluateGrantGate` treats as uncapped (optional-when-absent,
this record's own AC 4).

## Step 3: Body-shape re-verification (before granting)

Identical rule to `refine-mode.md` Step 3.5 — for every candidate Phase C resolves to
`grant: true`, re-verify the fetched body against `_shared/work-record.md`'s spec-shaped
definition (`## Current State`/`## Deliverables`/`## Acceptance Criteria` present and non-empty,
no `TBD`/`TODO`/`<!-- ambiguity:` markers outside the verbatim-preserved `## Original request` section) before writing any label — labels are projection, not
truth. A failing record downgrades to a skip with `failedKey: 'not-spec-shaped'` (this module's
own addition, not part of `grant-gate.js`'s chain, since body re-verification is a caller-level
concern the same way it is in `refine-mode.md`) — log it the same way as any other skip, comment
on the record:

```
Skipped by /claude-tweaks:backlog grant: body is not spec-shaped — missing/empty: {list}. This does not remove `ready`; a human or /claude-tweaks:backlog refine can still grant it after inspection.
```

Unlike `refine`'s Step 3.5, this mode does **not** remove `ready` on this downgrade — flag-back
is a human-gate action (`_shared/work-record.md`'s permission matrix: `/backlog refine` removes
`ready`, `/backlog grant` never does). Leaving `ready` in place lets a human or a subsequent
`refine` run reconsider it normally.

## Step 4: Apply

**Grant rows** (Phase C `grant: true`): bootstrap `auto:build` (+`auto:merge-pending` when
`result.autoMerge`) per `_shared/label-bootstrap.md`, same `LABELS_JSON` pair `refine-mode.md`
Step 5 uses. `auto:merge-pending` is a waypoint, not the final merge grant — it matures to
`auto:merge` at either merge-consult checkpoint named in `_shared/work-record.md`'s Grant
semantics maturation carve-out, gated by `grant-veto-window-hours` and vetoable by a human
removing the label before then. `bot:blocked` candidates take the **re-authorize**
path — strip `bot:blocked`, grant **`auto:build` only, never `auto:merge`/`auto:merge-pending`**,
regardless of what `result.autoMerge` says (mirrors `refine-mode.md` Step 3's `re-authorize
(bot:blocked)` row: "a prior failure means the human's renewed judgment is the point" — this
mode has no human in the loop for this decision, so the conservative floor is to never restore
merge trust on a re-authorization headlessly, full stop):

```bash
if gh issue view "$ISSUE" --json labels -q '.labels[].name' | grep -qx bot:blocked; then
  gh issue edit "$ISSUE" --remove-label bot:blocked --add-label auto:build
else
  gh issue edit "$ISSUE" --add-label auto:build
  if [ "$AUTO_MERGE" = "true" ]; then
    gh issue edit "$ISSUE" --add-label auto:merge-pending
  fi
fi
```

Unlike before #309, this step no longer seeds `merge-lane/watched.json` — a pending grant hasn't
merged anything yet, so there is nothing for the circuit breaker to watch. That seed now happens
at whichever maturation site actually promotes `auto:merge-pending` to `auto:merge` — Step 0.5
above names both.

**MCP path** (`gh` unavailable): see `mcp-transport.md`'s Step 4 section in this skill's directory
for the bot:blocked probe's and grant/re-authorize edit's MCP-tool equivalents.

Post the audit comment (evidence snapshot — see the Audit format below), then log to
`decisions.md`.

**Skip rows** (any `failedKey` set, at any phase): no label change, no comment on the record —
a skip is silent to the record itself (a human-filed record, an out-of-cap record, or a
transiently-unclean class should not accumulate visible noise every firing). Log to
`decisions.md` only, naming the exact `failedKey` and `reason` — no per-verdict branching, per
this record's own gate-chain design.

## Audit format

**Record comment** (grant rows only) — the evidence snapshot from `evaluateGrantGate`'s
`snapshot`, plus a machine-parseable marker the cap check (Step 2 above) reads back:

```
Machine-granted by /claude-tweaks:backlog grant (headless).

- Ceiling: unattended (grant-origination-enabled: true)
- Class: {classKey} — verdict: clean
- Origin: {origin}
- grant-check: clear — {rationale}
- Floors: merge-sensitive-paths clear, risk:{risk}, daily-grant-cap {n/a | "N of M"}
- Grants applied: auto:build{ + auto:merge-pending}

<!-- grant-mode-audit: date={YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ} auto-merge={true|false|pending} -->
```

This step only ever writes `pending` or `false` now, mirroring the "Grants applied" line right
above it — `true` is a pre-#309 legacy value this marker's own regex (`fleet-counters.js`'s
`GRANT_AUDIT_RE`) still has to match for backward-compat counting against comments posted before
this change, never a value a fresh comment from this step writes going forward.

The trailing HTML comment is the durable, greppable marker Step 2's cap-seeding count reads back
(`date=` truncated to the UTC calendar date for same-day comparison) — same dual-purpose
human-readable-plus-machine-marker convention `_shared/work-record.md`'s fingerprint marker
already uses.

**MCP path** (`gh` unavailable): see `mcp-transport.md`'s Audit format section in this skill's
directory for the comment post's MCP-tool equivalent.

**`decisions.md`** (this run's standalone-auto run dir):

```

AUTO {time} — Backlog grant: granted auto:build{ + auto:merge-pending} to #{n} (class {classKey}, verdict clean). Rationale: {grant-check RATIONALE}.
AUTO {time} — Backlog grant: re-authorized #{n} — stripped bot:blocked, granted auto:build only.
AUTO {time} — Backlog grant: skipped #{n} — {failedKey}: {reason}.
```

Every grant and every skip gets exactly one line — "no silent outcome in either direction" is
this record's own Deliverables wording, not a stylistic preference.

## Step 5: Report

No `AskUserQuestion` for any individual decision — this mode's entire point is that the gate
chain, not a human, decides. At the end, render a short summary (record count granted /
re-authorized / skipped, with skip reasons grouped by `failedKey`) and the Next Actions block
from `SKILL.md` (rendered only when a human is present — see that file's Next Actions section
and Component-Skill Contract).

## Cap tracking

`fleet-daily-grant-cap` counts machine grants issued **today** (UTC calendar date), read from
`<!-- grant-mode-audit: date=... -->` markers, not from an in-repo counter file (no durable
per-day state this mode owns — the record comments already are that state, and reading them back
avoids a second source of truth that could drift from what was actually granted). Seed
`grantsIssuedToday` once, before Phase C begins, by searching today's comments:

```bash
TODAY=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
gh search issues --repo "$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)" \
  --match comments "grant-mode-audit: date=${TODAY}" --json number | node -e "
    const rows = JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync(0, 'utf8'));
    console.log(rows.length);
  "
```

Increment the in-memory counter by one immediately after each grant is applied in Step 4 (not
just at the end) so a cap reached mid-run stops the remaining candidates in the same firing, not
only on the next one. When `fleet-daily-grant-cap` resolves empty (key unset — Phase C's own
resolver read above),
skip this whole section — `evaluateGrantGate` treats an absent cap as uncapped and this search
never runs (avoids an unnecessary `gh search` call on the common, uncapped-by-default path).

**MCP path, and a `gh`-form change too.** `gh search issues --match comments` rides the same
eventually-consistent search index `_shared/github-write-transport.md` already bans for
find-by-marker lookups (#1016/#1079/#1089) — see `mcp-transport.md`'s Cap tracking section in this
skill's directory for the bounded list-then-read-comments walk that replaces it on *both*
transports, plus its accepted small undercount caveat.

## Concurrency

Same reasoning as `refine-mode.md`'s Concurrency section: every label add is idempotent, so two
overlapping grant-mode firings (e.g. an overlapping Routine cadence) at worst repeat the same
write. The daily cap read is a snapshot at the start of each firing, not a lock — two concurrent
firings could each read the same "N of M" count and both grant, overshooting the cap by a small,
self-correcting margin. Acceptable for the same reason `refine-mode.md` accepts its own narrow
race: the next firing reads the true, now-current count and stops appropriately; this is not
worth a distributed lock for a soft fleet-hygiene cap.

**Holds unchanged on the MCP transport** — `mcp-transport.md`'s own Concurrency section works
through why `issue_write`'s plain field update preserves the same idempotency this section relies
on, and why `_shared/issue-claims.md`'s lock is not needed here on either transport (a different
problem — mutual exclusion over who *builds* an issue — that this mode's label-add writes never
had).
