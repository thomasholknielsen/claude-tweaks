# Trust Signal (Advisory, `github-issues` only)

Cited by `refine-mode.md` Step 3 — read this only when Step 3 actually reaches its Trust signal
gate; nothing else in this skill cites it.

Gate on the `{resolved-ceiling}` value Step 1 already resolved: fetch and render this run's trust
table only when `{resolved-ceiling}` is `trusted` or higher, **or** `--trust` was passed (see
`SKILL.md`'s Input). Below `trusted` with no `--trust`, skip everything else in this section —
`_shared/trust-table.md`'s Fetch section, including its per-parent branches and its `git log`
read, never runs this session — Trust evidence is omitted from the report for this run, and Step
4's footer renders the skip wording given there instead of the ceiling-description wording. On this
skip path, delete or ignore any pre-existing session-scoped `backlog-refine-trust.json` left over
from an earlier run in this same session (`_shared/session-tmp-root.md`; resolve the path, then
`rm -f "$path"`, or simply never read it) — this run must never render a stale trust table left
behind by a prior `--trust` invocation.

When fetching: run `_shared/trust-table.md`'s Fetch section in full (including its
`backlog-fetch-limit` resolution, its `work-links` resolution — which decides which of the two
parent-issue branches to run — and its truncation warning), then look up each worklist record's
class. `{resolved-ceiling}` and `{resolved-window}` below are the literal values Step 1 already
resolved — do not re-run `resolve-policy.js` here, and do not `export` them in an earlier Bash call
and read `process.env` here: shell environment does not survive between Bash calls and never
reaches a subagent, so that expansion always resolves empty and this block would report
`supervised` on a repo configured for `trusted`. It is the same hazard, and the same fix, as the
`backlog-fetch-limit` substitution in the Fetch section this step already cites. The failure is
quiet and in the safe direction, which is exactly why it needs stating: nothing errors, the console
simply renders a false claim about live policy.

This trust block reuses `/tmp/trust-table-git-log.txt`, already written by the Fetch section above — it must never shell its own separate `git log` call, or its verdicts could silently disagree with the trust table this same run just rendered from the identical underlying evidence.
`{resolved-window}` reaches the script as a `process.argv` arg after `--`, never spliced into the
JS source — a value containing a quote character would otherwise break out of the string literal,
the same reason `code-health/focus-mode.md`'s F1 block passes its own values that way.

**This signal never changes what the gate recommends.** `/claude-tweaks:assess-agent-autonomy`'s
`grant-check` remains the sole source of the Recommended column — it reads *this record's* content,
where trust describes *this record's class*, and a class verdict is not evidence about a specific
record's shape. Trust rides along as context for the human making the batch decision. The one thing
the ceiling does change is described in Step 3.6.
