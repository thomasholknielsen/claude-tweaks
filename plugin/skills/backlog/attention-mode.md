# Backlog — Attention Mode

Read-only, like `overview` mode — no writes, no grants. Unifies discovery of every open record
carrying any `needs:*` label, `solution:unjustified`, `ready` + `shaped:headless` with no
`auto:build` grant, or `bot:blocked` into one ranked list with a per-row, type-differentiated
recommended action, plus two non-record rows — a merge-lane circuit-breaker banner and a
tidy-residue row, rendered above the ranked table independently of it. This is the "what does the
backlog need from me today"
surface — distinct from `/claude-tweaks:help`'s Triage Queue (awaiting authorization, flagged or
not) and Acceptance Queue (awaiting sign-off), which cover different concerns.

## Step 1: Fetch

The `needs:*` family and `bot:blocked` are read from the session-scoped record snapshot
(`_shared/record-queue-fetch.md`'s Session-scoped record snapshot section) rather than a
dedicated `gh issue list --label` call: resolve `snapshotPath($CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID)` and reuse
it when fresh, falling through to one plain `gh issue list --state open --json {UNION_FIELDS}
--limit 200` refresh when stale or absent, adapted from that contract's plain-fetch fallback. The resulting
open-record set is then filtered to two sets: records whose labels include any name starting with
`needs:`, and records whose labels include `bot:blocked` — a record can land in both.

Two `gh issue list` calls remain direct label-based fetches (`needs:*` and `bot:blocked` now come
from the session-scoped snapshot above, not from a `--label` call). `--label` ANDs multiple values
passed to the same flag, which cuts both ways here, so the two shapes below are deliberate and
must not be normalized into each other:

- The `solution:unjustified` fetch is its own **single-label** call precisely because of that AND
  — merging it into the `ready`+`shaped:headless` call below would AND all three labels together,
  returning only records carrying all three (nearly always empty), not any of them on their own.
  Never merge it into that call.
- The `ready` + `shaped:headless` fetch passes **two labels to one call on purpose** — it wants
  exactly the AND: records carrying both. **Do not "fix" it by splitting it into separate
  `--label ready` / `--label shaped:headless` calls** — the rationale above is about
  `solution:unjustified` staying single-label, and splitting this one silently widens it to every
  `ready` record plus every `shaped:headless` record, which is not what this classification is.

Every temp file this mode writes below resolves through `bin/lib/session-tmp.js`'s `sessionTmpPath`, per `_shared/session-tmp-root.md`'s session-scoped temp-root convention (cited once here, not restated per script).

```bash
eval "$(node -e "
  const { sessionTmpPath } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/session-tmp.js');
  const os = require('os'); const path = require('path');
  const files = {
    ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SNAPSHOT_RAW: 'backlog-attention-snapshot-raw.json',
    ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SNAPSHOT_FILTERED: 'backlog-attention-snapshot-filtered.json',
    ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SOLUTION_UNJUSTIFIED: 'backlog-attention-solution-unjustified.json',
    ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SHAPED_HEADLESS: 'backlog-attention-shaped-headless.json',
  };
  for (const [varName, filename] of Object.entries(files)) {
    const p = sessionTmpPath(process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID, filename) || path.join(os.tmpdir(), filename);
    console.log(varName + '=' + JSON.stringify(p));
  }
")"
SNAPSHOT=$(node -e "console.log(require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/record-snapshot.js').snapshotPath(process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID) || '')")
TTL=$(node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-policy.js" --values record-snapshot-ttl-seconds)
if [ -n "$SNAPSHOT" ] && node -e "
  const { isFresh } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/record-snapshot.js');
  process.exit(isFresh(process.argv[1], Number(process.argv[2])) ? 0 : 1)
" "$SNAPSHOT" "$TTL"; then
  cp "$SNAPSHOT" "$ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SNAPSHOT_RAW"
else
  FIELDS=$(node -e "console.log(require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/record-snapshot.js').UNION_FIELDS)")
  LIMIT=$(node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-policy.js" --values backlog-fetch-limit)
  gh issue list --state open --json "$FIELDS" --limit "$LIMIT" > "$ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SNAPSHOT_RAW"
fi
node -e "
  const records = require('$ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SNAPSHOT_RAW').filter((r) => !r.state || r.state === 'OPEN');
  const needsRecords = records.filter((r) => r.labels.some((l) => l.name.startsWith('needs:')));
  const botBlockedRecords = records.filter((r) => r.labels.some((l) => l.name === 'bot:blocked'));
  console.log(JSON.stringify({ needsRecords, botBlockedRecords }));
" > "$ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SNAPSHOT_FILTERED"
gh issue list --state open --label solution:unjustified --json number,title,createdAt,labels --limit 200 > "$ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SOLUTION_UNJUSTIFIED"
gh issue list --state open --label ready --label shaped:headless --json number,title,createdAt,labels --limit 200 > "$ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SHAPED_HEADLESS"
```

The `cp` branch reuses the shared session cache read-only — it is never written back here, since
this mode's own fallback fetch narrows to `--state open` only (the shared cache is `--state all`,
per `_shared/record-queue-fetch.md`), and writing that narrower result back would silently starve
a later consumer in the same session of closed-record data it expects the shared cache to carry.

If the snapshot-fallback fetch returns exactly the resolved `backlog-fetch-limit` results, or
either of the two direct `--label` fetches below returns exactly `200`, state that in the
rendered output — the same "may be more, here's the count" convention `/claude-tweaks:help`'s own
fetches use — rather than silently treating it as complete. The `shaped-headless` fetch additionally needs `auto:build`
excluded, done in Step 2's merge script (below) rather than via a `gh` query flag — `gh issue
list --label` only ANDs, it has no exclusion flag, matching this file's own established idiom of
doing set logic in the `node -e` merge step rather than the `gh` query.

## Step 2: Merge and dedupe

Merge by issue number. A record's number appearing in more than one of these sets is not assumed
impossible — no automated path stamps every one of these markers together today, but a human can
always add any combination directly, so the merge must not assume the sets are disjoint. When a
number appears in more than one, render **one row** for it: `Type` joins the matched types with
` + ` (e.g. `needs:definition + solution:unjustified`, or `needs:decision + bot:blocked`), and
`Recommended action` concatenates each matched type's remedy in that same order,
semicolon-separated. A record can in principle carry every classification at once — e.g.
`needs:definition` + `needs:decision` + `solution:unjustified` + `shaped:headless (no grant)` +
`bot:blocked` — the same one-row-per-number, concatenated-action convention applies regardless of
how many match; `types` is always rendered in fetch order (the matched `needs:*` label name(s)
first, in the order they appear on the record's own `labels` array, then `solution:unjustified`,
then `shaped:headless (no grant)`, then `bot:blocked`) for a deterministic Type column.

A record whose types include `needs:decision` also needs the live proposal text for Step 4: read
its newest comment matching `<!-- needs-decision:` with no `**Resolved:**` line anywhere in its
body (`_shared/work-record.md`'s Decision-comment template and resolution rule), and capture that
comment's `**Proposed:** {text}` line verbatim. The snapshot-filtered `needsRecords` set already
carries each record's `comments` array (part of `_shared/record-queue-fetch.md`'s `UNION_FIELDS`,
present on both the cache-hit and the plain-fetch fallback path above) — read `Proposed:` from
there directly; only if a record object somehow lacks a `comments` array does the merge fall back
to a live `gh issue view {n} --json comments` call, mirroring `grant-lane-decision.md`'s own
comment-query shape.

```bash
eval "$(node -e "
  const { sessionTmpPath } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/session-tmp.js');
  const os = require('os'); const path = require('path');
  const files = {

    ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SOLUTION_UNJUSTIFIED: 'backlog-attention-solution-unjustified.json',
    ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SHAPED_HEADLESS: 'backlog-attention-shaped-headless.json',
    ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_MERGED: 'backlog-attention-merged.json',
  };
  for (const [varName, filename] of Object.entries(files)) {
    const p = sessionTmpPath(process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID, filename) || path.join(os.tmpdir(), filename);
    console.log(varName + '=' + JSON.stringify(p));
  }
")"
node -e "
  const { execFileSync } = require('child_process');
  const { needsRecords, botBlockedRecords } = require('$ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SNAPSHOT_FILTERED');
  const solutionUnjustified = require('$ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SOLUTION_UNJUSTIFIED');
  const shapedHeadless = require('$ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_SHAPED_HEADLESS')
    .filter((r) => !r.labels.some((l) => l.name === 'auto:build'));
  const byNumber = new Map();
  for (const r of needsRecords) {
    const needsTypes = r.labels.filter((l) => l.name.startsWith('needs:')).map((l) => l.name);
    byNumber.set(r.number, { ...r, types: [...needsTypes] });
  }
  for (const r of solutionUnjustified) {
    const existing = byNumber.get(r.number);
    if (existing) existing.types.push('solution:unjustified');
    else byNumber.set(r.number, { ...r, types: ['solution:unjustified'] });
  }
  for (const r of shapedHeadless) {
    const existing = byNumber.get(r.number);

  }

    const existing = byNumber.get(r.number);
    if (existing) existing.types.push('bot:blocked');
    else byNumber.set(r.number, { ...r, types: ['bot:blocked'] });

  function getComments(r) {
    if (Array.isArray(r.comments)) return r.comments;
    try {
      const out = execFileSync('gh', ['issue', 'view', String(r.number), '--json', 'comments'], { encoding: 'utf8' });
      return JSON.parse(out).comments || [];
    } catch {
      return [];
    }
  }
  for (const r of byNumber.values()) {
    if (!r.types.includes('needs:decision')) continue;
    const live = getComments(r)
      .filter((c) => c.body && /^<!-- needs-decision: (\S+) -->/m.test(c.body) && !c.body.includes('**Resolved:**'))
      .sort((a, b) => new Date(a.createdAt) - new Date(b.createdAt))
      .pop();
    const match = live && live.body.match(/\*\*Proposed:\*\*\s*(.+)/);
    r.proposed = match ? match[1].trim() : null;
  }
  console.log(JSON.stringify([...byNumber.values()]));
" > "$ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_MERGED"
```

## Step 3: Rank

Priority band first (`priority:high` > `priority:medium` > `priority:low`), then oldest
`createdAt` first within a band — the identical two-key ordering `/claude-tweaks:dispatch`'s own
`next` ranking uses (`dispatch/SKILL.md`'s Step 3), not a third scheme. A record with no priority
label sorts after every banded record, ordered among themselves by `createdAt` only.

```bash
eval "$(node -e "
  const { sessionTmpPath } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/session-tmp.js');
  const os = require('os'); const path = require('path');
  const files = {
    ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_MERGED: 'backlog-attention-merged.json',
    ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_RANKED: 'backlog-attention-ranked.json',
  };
  for (const [varName, filename] of Object.entries(files)) {
    const p = sessionTmpPath(process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID, filename) || path.join(os.tmpdir(), filename);
    console.log(varName + '=' + JSON.stringify(p));
  }
")"
node -e "
  const { parseRecordFacets } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/record.js');
  const BAND_ORDER = { high: 0, medium: 1, low: 2 };
  const records = require('$ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_MERGED');
  const ranked = records
    .map((r) => ({ ...r, priority: parseRecordFacets(r.labels).priority }))
    .sort((a, b) => {
      const bandA = a.priority && BAND_ORDER[a.priority] !== undefined ? BAND_ORDER[a.priority] : 3;
      const bandB = b.priority && BAND_ORDER[b.priority] !== undefined ? BAND_ORDER[b.priority] : 3;
      if (bandA !== bandB) return bandA - bandB;
      return new Date(a.createdAt) - new Date(b.createdAt);
    });
  console.log(JSON.stringify(ranked));
" > "$ST_BACKLOG_ATTENTION_RANKED"
```

## Step 3.5: Non-record rows

Two rows render above the ranked table, in this order, independently of whether the table itself
has any rows.

### Breaker banner

Best-effort read the global merge-lane circuit breaker, same snippet shape as
`merge-lane-reset.md`'s own read:

```bash
node -e "
  const { readBreakerState } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/merge-lane-breaker.js');
  console.log(JSON.stringify(readBreakerState(process.cwd())));
"
```

Render the banner only when the read succeeds, `tripped: true`, and the result is not the
degraded fail-closed shape (`transientReadFailure: true`) `readBreakerState` returns on a genuine
fetch failure — mirroring `merge-lane-reset.md`'s own "a read failure degrades to skip" posture: a
read failure or the degraded shape omits the banner entirely, never renders a false-positive
tripped state. When it renders:

```
⚠ Merge-lane circuit breaker tripped {trippedAt} by #{trippedBy.record}: {trippedBy.reason} — run /claude-tweaks:backlog refine --reset-breaker
```

### Tidy row

Glob `{$RUN_ROOT}/.claude-tweaks/pipelines/*-tidy-standalone*/staged/`, with `$RUN_ROOT` resolved
per `_shared/pipeline-run-dir.md`'s Anchoring section (`git rev-parse --git-common-dir`, normalized
— never a bare relative path, `[IL-127]`). Take the newest matching run directory by its
ISO-timestamp prefix. When that directory's `staged/` holds one or more files, render:

```
{count} tidy proposal(s) staged awaiting approval — run /claude-tweaks:tidy --approve
```

Omit the row entirely when no such directory exists, or its `staged/` is empty or absent.
**Accepted limitation:** only the single newest matching directory is ever surfaced (this row's
own newest-directory selection rule above, with no walk-back of its own) — if two tidy runs both
left non-empty `staged/` before either was approved, the older one stays invisible on this row
until the newer is resolved, so resolving it surfaces the next-newest on this row's next render
(archival removes the resolved run from the glob's candidate pool entirely). `tidy --approve`'s
own no-arg default (`tidy/approve-mode.md`) shares this row's glob-and-sort rule and picks the
same directory as this row whenever that directory's `staged/` is already non-empty, but
additionally walks back past an empty-`staged/` newest run to an older non-empty one — so when
the newest run's own `staged/` is already empty, `--approve` can find work this row is omitted
and showing nothing for.

## Step 4: Render

The two non-record rows from Step 3.5 render first, each on its own line, each independently
omitted when its own condition doesn't hold; the ranked table follows:

```markdown
⚠ Merge-lane circuit breaker tripped {trippedAt} by #{trippedBy.record}: {trippedBy.reason} — run /claude-tweaks:backlog refine --reset-breaker

{count} tidy proposal(s) staged awaiting approval — run /claude-tweaks:tidy --approve

## Backlog — Needs Attention

| Record | Type | Filed | Recommended action |
|--------|------|-------|---------------------|
| #{n} | needs:definition | {createdAt, relative} | run /claude-tweaks:specify #{n} to route through brainstorming |
| #{n} | needs:decision | {createdAt, relative} | run /claude-tweaks:backlog refine #{n} — proposed: "{Proposed line, verbatim}" |
| #{n} | solution:unjustified | {createdAt, relative} | run /claude-tweaks:challenge #{n} for the evidence-or-accept-risk verdict on the flag |
| #{n} | shaped:headless (no grant) | {createdAt, relative} | run /claude-tweaks:backlog refine to grant via the sweep's Grant lane (spec was headlessly shaped — no human has reviewed it) |
| #{n} | bot:blocked | {createdAt, relative} | run /claude-tweaks:backlog refine #{n} to re-authorize after the failure |
| #{n} | needs:definition + solution:unjustified | {createdAt, relative} | run /claude-tweaks:specify #{n} to route through brainstorming; run /claude-tweaks:challenge #{n} for the evidence-or-accept-risk verdict on the flag |

Pick up next: #{n} "{title}" — {oldest/highest-priority reason}.
```

`needs:definition` rows recommend `run /claude-tweaks:specify #{n} to route through
brainstorming`. `solution:unjustified` rows recommend `run /claude-tweaks:challenge #{n} for the
evidence-or-accept-risk verdict on the flag` — naming `/claude-tweaks:challenge` explicitly as the
mechanism that renders the actual accept-risk-or-add-evidence choice, since this mode itself
performs no grant and reads no evidence judgment on its own.

Every other `needs:*` value — starting with `needs:decision`, and including any `needs:*` marker
this file doesn't name individually — recommends `run /claude-tweaks:backlog refine #{n} to
resolve the {type} marker`, with one per-type clause added on top: a `needs:decision` row
replaces the generic clause with `run /claude-tweaks:backlog refine #{n} — proposed: "{Proposed
line, verbatim}"` (the record's captured `proposed` text from Step 2, quoted exactly);
`shaped:headless (no grant)` keeps its existing no-human-reviewed clause, `run
/claude-tweaks:backlog refine to grant via the sweep's Grant lane (spec was headlessly shaped —
no human has reviewed it)` — bare `refine`'s Grant lane (the sweep), never `refine #{n}` (the
per-record resolver has no grant path for a `shaped:headless`-only row: `refine-record.md`'s own
fetch reads only decision comments and `bot:blocked`, so pointing this row at `refine #{n}` would
route the human to a command that finds nothing to grant); `bot:blocked` says `run
/claude-tweaks:backlog refine #{n} to re-authorize after the failure`. This `refine #{n}` catch-all is the **permanent default** for any future `needs:*`
marker — a new marker earns a dedicated launcher only by a later record's own explicit decision,
never by default. The trailing "Pick up next" line names the single oldest/highest-priority
record across all types — the same shape `overview` mode's own "what to build next" recommendation
uses; it is derived from the ranked table only, never from the two non-record rows above it.

When the merged list is empty, render `Nothing needs attention — no open record carries a
needs:* marker, solution:unjustified, an ungranted shaped:headless spec, or bot:blocked.` instead
of an empty table, and omit the "Pick up next" line. The breaker banner and tidy row still render
independently above this message when their own conditions hold — an empty table is not an empty
mode output.

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| A single `gh issue list --label solution:unjustified --label ready --label shaped:headless` call | `--label` ANDs multiple values within one call — this returns only records carrying all three, nearly always empty |
| Granting, closing, or shaping anything from this mode | Read-only, like `overview` — the recommended actions are for the human to run, never executed here |
| Inventing a third ranking scheme | Reuse `/claude-tweaks:dispatch`'s existing priority-band-then-age ordering |
| A separate row per matched type for a record carrying two or more of the classifications | Dedupe by issue number and render one row with a concatenated Type/Recommended action, however many types matched |
| Rendering the breaker banner from a failed/degraded read | `merge-lane-reset.md`'s fail-open posture — omit, never a false-positive tripped state |
