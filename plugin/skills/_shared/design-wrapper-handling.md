# Design Wrapper Result Handling

Canonical contract for skills that invoke `/claude-tweaks:design-wrapper <mode>`. The wrapper returns one of four shape categories; this file defines what each means and how callers should respond.

Referenced from `/build` (Common Step 1.7 / pre-build), `/test` (Step 1.5 / test), `/review` (Step 6.5 / review), and any future caller. Each caller keeps its own mode-specific Result Handling table — this file documents the **universal return shapes** and the **why-skips-don't-fail** rationale so callers don't duplicate them.

## Return shapes

| Shape | When | What the caller does |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| `{result: "ok" \| "pass" \| "advisory", ...}` | The mode ran and produced output | Act on the output per the mode's contract (inject references, fail on errors, surface findings — see each caller's mode-specific table). |
| `{result: "fail", findings: [...]}` | The mode ran and found blocking issues (e.g., `test` mode found `severity: warning`) | Fail the caller's gate. Surface findings to the user. Do not auto-fix — design findings require human judgment. |
| `{skipped: {reason: ...}}` | Non-frontend project, Impeccable not installed, kill-switch disabled, no UI files in diff, or other legitimate skip condition | Note the skip in the caller's log and proceed. **Skip is not a failure.** |
| `{deferred: {reason: ...}}` | Reserved shape for a future decision-staging outcome — no mode currently returns this (see below) | Treat as skip and proceed. |

## Why skips don't fail

The wrapper skips for legitimate, non-error reasons:

- The project is backend-only (no frontend files detected).
- The Impeccable plugin is not installed.
- The kill switch is enabled (`design-integration: disabled` in project policy).
- There are no UI files in the changed diff.

None of these are errors. The design CLI is a value-add on frontend projects — its absence must never block a passing build, test, or review. Callers report the skip reason in their summary and continue.

## Why `deferred` is reserved but currently unused

No mode's actual "Output to caller" contract (`design-wrapper/modes/*.md`) ever returns `{deferred: ...}` today — including `survey`, whose full return contract resolves only to `{mode, result: "ok", context, recommendations, suppressed}` or a skip object (see `design-wrapper/modes/survey.md`). This shape is defined here for callers to handle defensively, in case a future mode adds a genuine decision-staging outcome. If a caller receives `{deferred: ...}` from any mode today, that is a wrapper bug; treat as skip and proceed (the wrapper will log it for follow-up).

## Why `live` mode has no auto-mode branch

Every other mode either runs deterministically or degrades to a skip under `auto`. `live` cannot — it hands control to a human clicking in their own browser, which structurally requires a human to be present. Callers must gate invocation to interactive, standalone contexts themselves; the wrapper's own preconditions do not (and cannot) enforce this, since "is a human present" isn't a signal the wrapper can check.

## Routing findings into Step 3 (for `/review`)

When `/review` receives `{result: "advisory", findings: [...]}` and the user wants to action design findings inline, treat each finding as an additional row in the Code Review Findings table with category `Design Quality`. This keeps the resolution mechanics consistent with code-review findings (fix now / defer / accept).

## Routing references into the implementer (for `/build`)

When `/build` receives `{result: "ok", loaded: [...], context_size: <n>}` from `pre-build`, inject the loaded reference paths and contents into the implementer subagent's prompt. When `context_size` exceeds the implementer's budget (rough threshold: 8000 tokens), summarize the references rather than passing them whole.

## Caller-side pre-check (skip the `Skill()` load when the wrapper would no-op)

Before invoking `/claude-tweaks:design-wrapper <mode> ...`, run the same deterministic detection the wrapper runs internally as its own Universal preconditions Step 1 (`design-wrapper/SKILL.md`) — its code twin is a standalone CLI, so a caller can reach the same verdict without paying for the wrapper's `SKILL.md` (~40KB) plus mode sub-file load when the answer is already "no-op":

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/design-detect.js" --mode <mode> --files "<comma-joined changed files>" [--surface <value>]
```

- `--mode` — the same mode the caller is about to invoke (`test`, `review`, `pre-build`, ...).
- `--files` — the caller's own already-resolved changed-file list (`git diff --name-only`, comma-joined) — never a fresh resolution just for this check.
- `--surface` — the record's materialized header `surface:` field (`flow/materialize.md`), when exactly one record is in scope (read from `$PIPELINE_RUN_DIR/work/*-spec.md`'s frontmatter). Omit when no single record is resolvable (a multi-record run scoped to more than one spec, or a standalone invocation with no active pipeline run) — the CLI degrades to a `null` surface exactly as the wrapper's own Layer 2 does when no `Surface:` line exists, and Layer 1/Layer 3 still apply. Never approximate a surface value by other means (label text, file-path guessing) — omitting the flag is the only correct way to say "unknown."
- Omit `--design-integration`/`--claude-md` — the CLI reads this project's own `CLAUDE.md` by default, the same file the wrapper's own Layer 1 reads.

The CLI prints one JSON line:

- `{"decision": "skip", "reason": "..."}` — skip the `Skill(claude-tweaks:design-wrapper)` call entirely. Report the skip in the caller's own output using the CLI's `reason` string verbatim — the same wire vocabulary the wrapper's own `{skipped: reason}` return already uses (see "Return shapes" above), so a caller's result-handling table needs no separate branch for a pre-check skip vs. a wrapper-returned skip.
- `{"decision": "proceed", ...}` — invoke the wrapper as documented; the pre-check has proven detection would not have skipped, but the wrapper's own mode-specific procedure (availability check, CLI/LLM dispatch) still runs as normal.

This pre-check reproduces the wrapper's Layers 1-3 exactly — it is the wrapper's own code (`bin/lib/design-detect`), not an approximation — so it can never diverge from what the wrapper would have decided. It never changes behavior for a case it doesn't skip; it only removes the wrapper's own `SKILL.md` (and mode sub-file) load for the cases the wrapper would have no-opped on anyway.
