# Record Queue Fetch — Shared Procedure

Single source of truth for the first read every open-work-record scan performs: resolve
`work-backend`, fetch the queue, and facet-parse it. Consumed by `/claude-tweaks:help`
(`status-scan.md` Stage 1), `/claude-tweaks:tidy` (`tidy/step-1-records.md`, its Step 1),
`/claude-tweaks:backlog` (both `refine-mode.md`'s and `overview-mode.md`'s Step 1), and
`/claude-tweaks:visualize` (`visualize/record-graph.md` Step A) — every one of these scans
starts from the identical fetch below before branching into its own consumer-specific
classification (dashboard bucket counts for `/help`; the per-shape finding classification for `/tidy`;
priority/Related synthesis plus the grant worklist for `/backlog refine`, lens routing plus the
build recommendation for `/backlog overview`; stage-column bucketing plus six-axis encoding for
`/visualize record-graph`).
Subagents cannot read this file — the dispatcher inlines this section into the scan agent's
prompt, the same pattern already used for `_shared/github-pr-scan.md`.

## `work-backend` resolution

Read the `work-backend` field from the project's CLAUDE.md (`_shared/work-record.md`'s Config
keys table, written by `/claude-tweaks:init`). A missing flag is treated as `local-files`.

Every consumer reads `work-backend` directly, with no alias fallback.

## Session-scoped record snapshot

One continuous session pulling the whole issue set independently per skill invocation (`/backlog
overview` then `/capture` then `/specify`, each with no shared cache) burns one round-trip per
call for identical data. Under `work-backend: github-issues`, every fetch in this file — the base
`github-issues` fetch below, and every direct consumer that names this section instead of the
open-only contract (`/claude-tweaks:capture`'s born-ready check, `/claude-tweaks:specify` Step 1 +
its Idempotency map, `_shared/trust-table.md`'s Fetch section) — reads through one session-scoped
snapshot instead of shelling out on every call.

- **Path** — `bin/lib/issues/record-snapshot.js`'s `snapshotPath($CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID)`:
  `/tmp/ct-records-{session-id}.json`. A subagent that cannot see `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` (the
  dispatcher inlines this file rather than letting a subagent read it directly — see the header
  note above) gets `null` back from `snapshotPath`/`gitLogPath` for an absent session id, which
  `isFresh` reads as never-fresh — the caller falls through to a plain fetch every time, the same
  as before this section existed. Nothing breaks; only the caching benefit is unavailable to a
  session-id-less caller.
- **Field set** — the union every consumer needs, so one fetch covers all of them:
  `number,title,labels,body,state,stateReason,createdAt,closedAt,comments,updatedAt,milestone`
  (`record-snapshot.js`'s `UNION_FIELDS` — the code twin of this line; cite the constant, never
  retype the field list).
- **Freshness** — the snapshot file's mtime younger than `record-snapshot-ttl-seconds` seconds
  (`policy.yml`, default 300 — `_shared/policy-schema.md`'s Additional levers table).
  `record-snapshot.js`'s `isFresh(path, ttlSeconds)` is the single check every consumer below
  runs; never hand-roll an `mtime` comparison inline.
- **Invalidation** — any `gh issue create`/`edit`/`close` (or its MCP equivalent) by a plugin
  skill deletes the snapshot via `record-snapshot.js`'s `invalidateSnapshot($CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID)`
  immediately after the write succeeds, so the next consumer re-fetches instead of reading stale
  state — see `_shared/github-write-transport.md`'s note on the CRUD mapping table, the single
  point every create/edit/close call site in the plugin already routes through.

**Read-fresh-or-fetch, in every consumer below:**

```bash
SESSION_ID="${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID:-}"
TTL=$(node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-policy.js" --values record-snapshot-ttl-seconds)
SNAPSHOT=$(node -e "console.log(require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/record-snapshot.js').snapshotPath(process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID) || '')")
if [ -n "$SNAPSHOT" ] && node -e "
  const { isFresh } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/record-snapshot.js');
  process.exit(isFresh(process.argv[1], Number(process.argv[2])) ? 0 : 1)
" "$SNAPSHOT" "$TTL"; then
  cp "$SNAPSHOT" {tmp-records-file}
else
  LIMIT=$(node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-policy.js" --values backlog-fetch-limit)
  export FETCH_LIMIT="$LIMIT"
  FIELDS=$(node -e "console.log(require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/record-snapshot.js').UNION_FIELDS)")
  gh issue list --state all --json "$FIELDS" --limit "$LIMIT" > {tmp-records-file}
  [ -n "$SNAPSHOT" ] && cp {tmp-records-file} "$SNAPSHOT"
fi
```

This block always fetches `--state all` (the union covers both open and closed consumers) and
always the full field set — there is no per-consumer `{EXTRA_FIELDS}` list to maintain anymore,
since the union already carries every field any consumer has ever needed. A consumer whose
existing contract wants only open records (the base `github-issues` fetch below, unchanged for
`/help`/`/tidy`/`/backlog`/`/visualize`) filters `state === 'OPEN'` out of `{tmp-records-file}` in
its own facet-parse pass rather than re-fetching narrower.

## `work-backend: github-issues` fetch

The fetch script below resolves `backlog-fetch-limit` itself via the canonical read path (per
`_shared/work-record.md`'s Config keys table) — the resolver applies the schema default when the
key is absent. `{tmp-records-file}` below is populated by the Session-scoped record snapshot's
read-fresh-or-fetch block above (run it first, substituting this section's own `{tmp-records-file}`
path into that block) — this section then narrows the snapshot's `--state all` union down to the
open-only, base-field contract every existing citer already expects: `/help`, `/tidy`, `/backlog`'s
Step 1, and `/visualize` need no changes to their own files for this — the snapshot layer is fully
internal to this fetch.

```bash
LIMIT=$(node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-policy.js" --values backlog-fetch-limit)
export FETCH_LIMIT="$LIMIT"
node -e "
  const { parseRecordFacets } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/record.js');
  const issues = require('{tmp-records-file}').filter((i) => i.state === 'OPEN');
  if (issues.length === Number(process.env.FETCH_LIMIT)) {
    console.error('WARNING: fetched exactly ' + issues.length + ' open issues (the configured backlog-fetch-limit) — there may be more beyond this cap. Consider raising backlog-fetch-limit in .claude-tweaks/policy.yml, or running /claude-tweaks:tidy to reduce backlog volume.');
  }
  console.log(JSON.stringify(issues.map((i) => ({ ...i, facets: parseRecordFacets(i.labels) }))));
" > {tmp-faceted-file}
```

Note that `{tmp-records-file}` now holds the **unfiltered** `--state all` snapshot content (open
and closed together) — the `.filter((i) => i.state === 'OPEN')` above is what narrows it down to
this section's open-only contract on the way to `{tmp-faceted-file}`. A consumer that reads
`{tmp-records-file}` directly instead of going through `{tmp-faceted-file}` (none do today) would
need to apply the same filter itself.

`backlog-fetch-limit` replaces the previous hardcoded 200/500 per-consumer limits — `gh issue list --limit N` auto-paginates internally regardless of how large `N` is, so raising the default doesn't change the fetch mechanism, only how much it's willing to pull before stopping. A consumer whose own population is naturally small (e.g. a `--label ready` filtered fetch) still uses this same limit and the same truncation check — the limit bounds "how many rows before we assume there might be more," not a per-consumer tuning knob.

`{EXTRA_FIELDS}` is retired — the session-scoped snapshot fetches the full union field set
(`body` included) on every pull, so `/claude-tweaks:help`'s Conflict detection, `/claude-tweaks:backlog`'s
priority/Related synthesis and `rankNextToBuild` dependency parsing, and `/claude-tweaks:visualize`'s
`Blocked by #N` parsing all already have `body` on `{tmp-faceted-file}` with no extra field to
request. `/claude-tweaks:tidy` needs no extra field for this fetch either — it pulls unsynced
local-fallback records via a separate, already-documented `queryRecords('specs', { unsynced: true })`
call in its own Step 1.

`parseRecordFacets` silently ignores any label it doesn't recognize (`bin/lib/issues/record.js`)
— a consumer that also needs the raw `labels` array (not just the parsed `facets`) keeps both,
since the spread above (`...i`) preserves every original field alongside the derived `facets`.

## `work-backend: local-files` fetch

```bash
node -e "
  const { queryRecords } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/local-store.js');
  console.log(JSON.stringify(queryRecords('specs', {})));
" > {tmp-faceted-file}
```

Every record returned already carries its parsed `.facets` — no separate parse pass needed.
Both drivers land in the same faceted-record shape (`{ ..., facets }`) at `{tmp-faceted-file}`
— only the fetch varies per driver; a consumer's own classification logic runs identically
against either driver's output.

## Staleness clock (either driver)

`github-issues` uses the query's own `updatedAt`, straight from the fetch above. `local-files`
has no timestamp facet (`local-store.js`'s schema carries none), so use the record file's own
last-commit date instead:

```bash
git -C "{REPO_ROOT}" log -1 --format=%cI -- "{path}"
```

An empty result — an uncommitted/brand-new record — is treated as fresh, not stale.
`{REPO_ROOT}` resolves via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` in the dispatcher before the agent
fires (see Working Directory Discipline in `_shared/subagent-output-contract.md`).

### Threshold resolution

Before computing staleness, read `record-staleness-weeks` from the project's CLAUDE.md (per
`_shared/work-record.md`'s Config keys table) and export it as `RECORD_STALENESS_WEEKS`; if
the key is absent, leave the variable unset so each consumer's own default (4) applies.
(This is a CLAUDE.md field read, not a `policy.yml` key — the policy resolver does not serve
it.) Each consumer's own classification script converts this to milliseconds
(`weeks * 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000`) and passes the result as `thresholdMs` to
`classifyStaleness(ageMs, thresholdMs)` (`bin/lib/issues/record-buckets.js`) — the conversion
is per-consumer inline code, not part of the shared module itself.
