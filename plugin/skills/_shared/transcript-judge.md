# Transcript Judge — Shared Dispatch Harness

Canonical procedure for dispatching a single Task agent to judge a session transcript against a
rubric, shared by every consumer that needs this mechanic. Consumers supply four parameters (see
"Consumer parameterization" below); everything else here is consumer-invariant and moved verbatim
from wherever it first shipped (`skills/feedback/session-evaluation.md`, #856) — nothing here
restates a consumer's own rubric or output shape.

Contract: this file. Consumers: `skills/feedback/session-evaluation.md` (consumer key `feedback`),
`skills/reflect/SKILL.md` Step 2 standalone dispatch (consumer key `reflect`, spec #857).

## Consumer parameterization

Every consumer supplies exactly these four inputs when following this file:

1. **Rubric** — the objective/lens file inlined verbatim as prompt item 1.
2. **Output template** — the literal per-objective template inlined as prompt item 2.
3. **Model profile** — a profile name (`frontier` / `capable` / `standard` / `fast`) passed to
   `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-profile.js" {profile}` (append `--run-dir
   "$PIPELINE_RUN_DIR"` when the consumer has one; append `--unattended` only when genuinely
   headless, resolved from session state).
4. **Watermark consumer key** — a short string passed as `{ consumer }` to every
   `bin/lib/transcript-judge/watermark.js` call; today's keys are the ones named on the Consumers
   line above. Pick a new, disjoint key for a third consumer — collision avoidance is the caller's
   responsibility.

A consumer may also supply a **watermark payload** shape beyond `bytesAtDispatch`/`evaluatedAt`
(e.g. feedback's `filedRecords`/`dismissedFingerprints`) — that shape is entirely consumer-owned
and named in the consumer's own file, never here.

## Transcript resolution

Runs in the main thread, before dispatch.

**Path:** `~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/<session-id>.jsonl`.

- **`<project-slug>`:** derived from the session's absolute working-directory path — each `/`,
  space, and `.` in that path is replaced by `-`. Worked example: `/Users/alice/projects/my-app`
  becomes `-Users-alice-projects-my-app`. A path segment starting with `.` (e.g. a `.claude`
  segment inside a worktree path) produces a doubled hyphen where the directory separator and the
  leading dot both convert — that doubling is correct, not a bug to normalize away.
- **`<session-id>`:** the value of `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`.

**Fallback — whenever the id-derived path does not resolve:** `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` unset, or
set but no file exists at the derived path (a stale or rotated session id) — pick the newest
`.jsonl` file in the resolved project-slug directory by mtime. Whenever this fallback ran at all,
the rendered report names the chosen file together with its mtime; when the directory holds more
than one `.jsonl` file, of any age, it also lists the ones ignored — never silent newest-wins.
Only when no candidate `.jsonl` exists at all (or the directory itself doesn't exist) does the
self-assessment degradation below apply.

**Scope statement:** this resolves the **main session's own transcript only.** Any Task agent
dispatched during this session wrote its own separate transcript file, which is out of scope here
— a named coverage gap, so a reader of the judge's output does not infer that dispatched-agent
work was evaluated.

**Watermark key:** the path resolved above is also the lookup key for
`bin/lib/transcript-judge/watermark.js`'s watermark (keyed with the consumer's own `{ consumer }`
parameter, parameterization point 4) — key on path, not session id, since a worktree switch
changes the transcript directory slug mid-session.

## The judge dispatch

Exactly one Task agent per invocation.

**Model:** resolve via `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-profile.js" {consumer-supplied
profile}` (parameterization point 3 above). Append `--unattended` only when this invocation is
genuinely headless — a scheduled Routine or a `claude -p` run — resolved from session state, never
a literal in skill text: the resolver reads that flag as "no human is present" and unconditionally
degrades Frontier on it. Degradation to Capable on a missed precondition is the resolver's own job,
logged in its `source` — never re-enumerated here. The cap counts evaluations, not retries: a
`NEEDS_CONTEXT` or `BLOCKED` return may be re-dispatched once with the missing context supplied;
a second failure degrades to the self-assessment path below rather than dispatching again.

**Prompt contents, in this order:**

1. The consumer-supplied rubric file, inlined verbatim (parameterization point 1).
2. The consumer-supplied literal output template, inlined verbatim (parameterization point 2).
3. The resolved transcript path from the previous section.
4. Slicing guidance: use Grep/Read to slice the transcript rather than reading it sequentially — a
   full sequential read is neither required nor expected on a long transcript. Per-objective
   evidence hints:
   - **Countable lenses** — anchor on keywords: `AskUserQuestion`, error/denial strings, tool
     names, repeated file paths.
   - **Judgment lenses** — sample rather than anchor: user turns plus each turn's final assistant
     text.
   - An objective the available slicing genuinely cannot reach renders `NOT EVALUATED — {reason}`,
     not a guess.
5. **Conditional — the watermark offset clause.** When `bin/lib/transcript-judge/watermark.js`'s
   `readWatermark` (with the consumer's own `{ consumer }` key) returns non-null for the resolved
   transcript path, append `formatOffsetClause(...)`'s literal output as this 5th item, verbatim:

   ```
   Evaluate from byte offset {bytesAtDispatch} (line {line}); these records already exist: {filedRecords joined by ", " or "none" if empty}; omit findings they cover. These fingerprints were previously declined: {dismissedFingerprints joined by ", " or "none" if empty}; omit findings matching them.
   ```

   When no watermark exists (first invocation) or a full-reset flag was passed, item 5 is omitted
   entirely — no offset clause, no empty placeholder.

**Finding norms (bind the consumer's own output template above):** every finding carries a
symptom, an evidence pointer, a proposed fix, and a `Cost this session:` line (one line; `unclear`
is valid — retries, hand-work, a reverted decision). Countable lenses additionally carry a
`Measurement:` line with a session-sizing denominator (e.g. total AskUserQuestion calls: {N}; {M}
of {N} resolved to the pre-marked Recommended option); judgment lenses omit it. **"NO FINDING" is
the expected common answer** — a lens that cannot be evidenced renders `NOT EVALUATED — {reason}`,
never a manufactured finding.

The status line is the contract's usual `DONE / DONE_WITH_CONCERNS / NEEDS_CONTEXT / BLOCKED`
first line, per `_shared/subagent-output-contract.md`.

## Degradation: self-assessment

Two routes land here: no transcript file resolves at all (Transcript resolution's fallback finds
nothing in the project-slug directory, or the directory itself doesn't exist — skip the Task
dispatch entirely), or the judge dispatch terminally failed (see After the judge returns). Either
way, evaluate in the main thread instead, over its own conversational context. Reuse the identical
per-objective output template, with `(self-assessment)` appended to each block's header line —
e.g. `## Avoidable interactions (self-assessment)`.

The `(self-assessment)` tag is the full mitigation, deliberately. No separate confidence
machinery, no lowered evidentiary bar — findings from this mode pass through the consumer's own
human-gated confirmation exactly like a transcript-judged finding does.

The self-assessment path never reads or writes a watermark — there is no resolved transcript path
to key one on.

## After the judge returns

Hand each returned finding to the consumer's own per-finding routing, unchanged by whether the
finding came from the judge or from self-assessment. A `NOT EVALUATED` block is not a finding:
report it in the run summary and never file it.

A reply that violates the template — missing the status line, or missing per-objective blocks —
is re-prompted once on format, per `_shared/subagent-output-contract.md`. A terminal failure —
the format retry also fails, the re-dispatch above was already spent, or the dispatch itself
hard-errors (e.g. a model usage-limit failure) — records the failed model via
`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-profile.js" record-failure {model}` per `_shared/subagent-output-contract.md`'s
Model Selection section, then degrades to the self-assessment path above, noted in the run
summary: the evaluation is never silently dropped.

**Watermark write.** On a `DONE` or `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS` return from the judge (not
`NEEDS_CONTEXT`/`BLOCKED`, and not the self-assessment degradation path above), call
`writeWatermark` (with the consumer's own `{ consumer }` key) with:

```
{
  transcriptPath,
  bytesAtDispatch,        // captured BEFORE dispatch — the judge's own tool calls append
                           // to the transcript while it runs, so re-stat-ing after return
                           // would race
  evaluatedAt,             // now
  ...consumer-owned payload fields (parameterization point 4's "watermark payload" note above)
}
```

On a write failure: degrade open — the evaluation result itself is unaffected, report the write
failure in the consumer's own Step-0-equivalent output as a one-line note, and never abort or
retry the evaluation because the watermark write failed.
