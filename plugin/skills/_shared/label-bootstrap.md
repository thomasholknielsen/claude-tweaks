# Label Bootstrap — Shared Check-Then-Create Snippet

The canonical check-then-create loop every label-filing skill in this codebase uses.
Referenced by the work-record consumers (`_shared/work-record.md` is the taxonomy home —
health skills, `/capture`, `/specify`, `/backlog`, `/dispatch`, `/tidy`,
`wrap-up/cleanup-procedures-execution.md` Section E and `flow/multispec-review-console.md` for the
shared `parked` restoration step). Consumers reference this file; do not restate the loop
inline.

Given a `LABELS` array of `[name, description]` pairs:

```bash
node -e "
  const { ensureLabelPayload } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/labels.js');
  const labels = ${LABELS_JSON};
  console.log(JSON.stringify(labels.map(([n, d]) => ensureLabelPayload(n, d))));
" > /tmp/label-bootstrap-payloads.json
node -e "const ls=require('/tmp/label-bootstrap-payloads.json'); ls.forEach(l => console.log(l.name + '\t' + l.description))" | while IFS=$'\t' read -r NAME DESCRIPTION; do
  gh label list --search "$NAME" --json name -q '.[].name' | grep -qx "$NAME" || \
    gh label create "$NAME" --description "$DESCRIPTION"
done
```

`ensureLabelPayload` throws at construction if a description exceeds GitHub's 100-char cap
(`bin/lib/issues/labels.js`) — a too-long description fails loudly here, not as a silent 422 on
`gh label create`. `${LABELS_JSON}` is a literal JS array-of-pairs, substituted inline by each
consumer with its own label list — for a single label, use a one-element array
(`[['bot:blocked', '...']]`) rather than reaching for a separate single-label variant.

## One-shot bootstrap marker

Before running the check-then-create loop above, every consumer checks one repo-wide marker
label instead of probing each label it's about to apply individually — this is the fix for the
common case (11 `gh label list` probes repeating every run once the canonical set already
exists):

```bash
gh label list --search "claude-tweaks:bootstrapped-v{LABEL_BOOTSTRAP_VERSION}" --json name -q '.[].name' \
  | grep -qx "claude-tweaks:bootstrapped-v{LABEL_BOOTSTRAP_VERSION}" && SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=true || SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=false
```

`{LABEL_BOOTSTRAP_VERSION}` is the literal integer below — **current value: `4`**. Bump it (and
this literal) whenever a label is added to or removed from the canonical `LABELS_JSON` array
below. A marker stamped under the old version no longer matches the search after a bump, so the
next consumer's Preflight falls through to the full loop, re-establishes the set (including
whatever changed), and re-stamps the marker at the new version — the versioning is what keeps this
compatibility path from silently stopping coverage of labels added later (IL-85).

- **`SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=true`** — the canonical set already exists (established by a prior consumer
  in this repo, or `/init`'s one-time provision-now offer). Skip the check-then-create loop
  entirely for this consumer's own labels — zero `gh label list` probes.
- **`SKIP_BOOTSTRAP=false`** — run the check-then-create loop above exactly as documented
  (unchanged: per-label probe-then-create). After it completes with no `ensureLabelPayload`
  errors, retire any stale-version marker and stamp the current one:
  ```bash
  gh label list --search "claude-tweaks:bootstrapped-v" --json name -q '.[].name' | grep "^claude-tweaks:bootstrapped-v" \
    | while read -r OLD; do gh label delete "$OLD" --yes 2>/dev/null; done
  gh label create "claude-tweaks:bootstrapped-v{LABEL_BOOTSTRAP_VERSION}" \
    --description "claude-tweaks: canonical label set established (internal bootstrap marker, not a work-record facet)" 2>/dev/null || true
  ```

The marker is bootstrap-only bookkeeping: never applied to an issue, never read by
`parseRecordFacets` (which ignores unrecognized label prefixes), and carries no locking
semantics — a race between two concurrent first-bootstrappers at worst runs the check-then-create
loop twice, which is already idempotent (`gh label list --search` gates every `gh label create`).
A virgin repo (no marker, no labels) still creates the full set on its first bootstrapping
consumer, exactly as today; only the *re-probing* on every subsequent run is what this marker
removes.

## Canonical LABELS_JSON — the full work-record taxonomy

The complete label set from `_shared/work-record.md`'s Label taxonomy table (the core label
families plus the optional `priority:*` family — see that table for the current per-family
and total counts, rather than a count restated here), with descriptions pre-checked against
GitHub's 100-character cap. **Consumers bootstrap only the labels they are about to apply** —
copy the relevant pairs, don't create the full array below speculatively (except `/init`'s
one-time provision-now offer, which uses this list whole):
