# Materiality Floor — routing legitimately-deferred, below-floor findings to a digest

Applied strictly **after** `_shared/deferral-gate.md`: an item first attempts fix-now, and only
an item that fails fix-now and carries a valid `Defer-reason:` from that gate's closed vocabulary
reaches this floor. The floor never decides whether to fix — it only decides which container a
*legitimately-deferred* item lands in. Citing this file as a reason to skip a fix, or to defer
without a valid `Defer-reason:`, is a misuse of both contracts; `_shared/deferral-gate.md`'s hard
gate still applies unchanged, and this file repeats that ordering deliberately because it is the
predictable failure mode.

## The floor

Route to the digest only when the item would be filed at **all three**: `size:low` AND
`priority:low` AND `risk:low` (`_shared/work-record.md`'s Label taxonomy table — Risk/Size/Priority
rows), judged at filing time by the routing skill itself — not read off an existing label, since
most filing paths never stamp `priority:*` (it is an optional family; only `/backlog refine`,
`/backlog attention`, `/dispatch`, and `/specify`'s `next` mode write it). The routing skill judges
all three axes as it would score a fresh filing, including the unstamped priority axis. An axis the
routing skill genuinely cannot judge, or judges ambiguously, counts as **not low** — the floor
fails toward filing an ordinary issue, never toward the digest.

## Overrides

- `Defer-reason: tangential` always clears the floor and files as an ordinary issue — a tangential
  finding is a new idea the finding suggests, not residue of the current work, and ideas are
  intent, not exhaust (`_shared/deferral-gate.md`'s vocabulary).
- Human-typed `/capture` input is out of this contract's scope entirely — human input is intent,
  never exhaust, and never routes to the digest.

## Entry format

```
- [{area}] {one-line finding} — {file refs} — Defer-reason: {value} — {provenance} <!-- materiality-fingerprint: {fp} -->
```

`{area}` is the subsystem the finding belongs to, written as a stable, low-cardinality, lowercase
token: the skill name (`tidy`, `review`), the `bin/lib/` module (`issues`, `hooks`), or the
top-level tree (`docs`, `tests`) the `{file refs}` sit under — never a sentence and never a
slash-prefixed command name. `tidy/digest-sweep.md`'s cluster promotion groups on this field by
exact match, so improvised per-run phrasings of the same area (`tidy` vs `/tidy` vs `the tidy
skill`) silently keep a real cluster below the ≥3 threshold forever.

`{provenance}` is the pipeline run-id when a run directory resolves (`$PIPELINE_RUN_DIR`'s
basename), else the invoking skill's name. The entry itself is the durable audit trail — a
no-run-dir routing is never unlogged.

`{fp}` is the entry's dedup fingerprint (`materialityFingerprint` in
`bin/lib/health-core/materiality-digest.js`), a stable hash of `{area}` + the finding text
(whitespace/case-normalized) + the file refs (order-independent) — see "Dedup" below.

### Dedup

A finding a scheduled sweep re-encounters on every firing must fold into its existing entry, not
append a fresh one on each run — the un-deduped entry count would otherwise cross
`tidy/digest-sweep.md`'s cluster-promotion threshold (≥3 entries sharing one `{area}`) purely
from repetition, promoting a genuinely low-value, repeatedly-recurring finding into a first-class
issue and inverting this floor's entire purpose. Before routing a candidate entry, the routing
skill calls `isMaterialityDuplicate(existingCommentBodies, candidate)`
(`bin/lib/health-core/materiality-digest.js`) against every comment on the open digest issue
(`github-issues`) or the current file body (`local-files`): a match means the finding is already
present and un-promoted — skip the append entirely, write no new entry, and do not count it a
second time toward the cluster-promotion threshold. No match means route it via
`materialityEntryLine(candidate)`, which composes the Entry-format line above with its fingerprint
marker embedded. This is the materiality-digest analog of the pre-existing drain-rate cap
digest's own dedup mechanism (`_shared/health-filing-digest.md`'s `expandDigestFingerprints`) —
a parallel mechanism, not a shared one, since the two digests dedup against different containers
(cap digest: embedded checklist items folded into the issue-index; materiality digest: entries
scattered across a rolling issue's comment history) and answer different questions (drain-rate
throttling vs. below-floor deferral).

### Direct-filing producers' `Defer-reason:` value

The four health sweeps (`code-health`, `docs-health`, `harness-health`, `journey-health`) never
route through `_shared/deferral-gate.md` — they file spec-shaped issues directly (`recordPayload`/
`specShapedBody`), so a below-floor finding of theirs reaches this file with no
`Defer-reason:` value from that gate's closed vocabulary to write. `Defer-reason: direct-filing-sweep`
is this Entry format's own documented value for exactly that producer class — a below-floor
finding a proactive, non-gate-routed sweep discovered on its own, not a deferral of fix-now work
this pipeline was already doing. Deliberately **not** added to `bin/lib/issues/record.js`'s
`DEFER_REASONS` (the closed vocabulary `_shared/deferral-gate.md` owns and
`tests/deferral-gate-conformance.test.js` pins): it is not a fix-now-failure reason at all, it is
a producer-class marker specific to this Entry format field, so widening the gate's own closed
vocabulary for it would blur a distinction the gate exists to keep — every other value in that
vocabulary answers "why did fix-now fail for an item this pipeline was already working on,"
which is not the question a proactive sweep's own fresh finding is answering. A future
non-gate-routed adopter of this floor uses the same value.

### Digest URL and count surfacing

When a run's routing sends one or more findings to the digest, the routing skill's own summary
output states the run's digest comment URL and the number of findings routed this run — the
digest activity must be visible in the caller's own output, not only in the digest issue itself.
Adopters cite this paragraph rather than restating it; `review/step3-routing.md` is the reference
implementation. The four health sweeps additionally fold their own count into the existing
drain-rate-cap throttle line (`_shared/health-filing-digest.md`'s SUMMARIZE step) as a distinct
`materiality: K` field, never combined with that line's own `digested: M` (cap-digest) count —
the two mechanisms answer different questions and a reader diagnosing either needs its own
number.

## Container

**`work-backend: github-issues`:** one pinned rolling issue labeled `digest`. Before routing, list
open `digest`-labeled issues (`gh issue list --label digest --state open`); create one only when
none exists, bootstrapping the label first (`_shared/label-bootstrap.md`). Route by posting one
comment per run, aggregating that run's below-floor items — one comment URL per run, never one
comment per item. All writes go through `_shared/github-write-transport.md`. Routing appends are
append-only; the one sanctioned exception is the `/tidy` digest sweep's promotion/expiry marker
edits (`tidy/digest-sweep.md`). A creation race that leaves two open `digest` issues is repaired
by that same sweep: merge the newer issue's comments into the older, then close the newer.

**The digest issue is a container, not a work record.** It carries no stage label by design, so
every record-scoped sweep that reads the open-issue queue classifies it as an ordinary backlog
record (`bin/lib/issues/record-buckets.js`'s `isBacklog` — stage `backlog` is the no-label
default). Every such sweep exempts a `digest`-labeled issue the same way `/tidy`'s Shape 1 already
exempts `parent-issue` (`tidy/step-1-records.md`): a digest issue is never shaped, scored,
promoted, or closed as a record. Without that exemption the container is `isBacklog` forever and
crosses any staleness threshold, where Shape 1's default recommendation is `Delete or Promote` —
closing the container out from under every entry it holds. Only the digest sweep's own lifecycle
(`tidy/digest-sweep.md`'s 100-comment rollover) ever closes a digest issue, and it bootstraps the
replacement in the same move.

**`work-backend: local-files`:** `specs/digest.md`, entries appended in place (single-writer
backend, no rollover needed). Promotion marks the entry line with a trailing `→ {id}`. Expiry
moves entry lines to an `## Archived {YYYY-MM-DD}` section at the bottom of the same file.

## Audit line

When a run directory resolves, routing additionally logs, per `_shared/auto-decision-log.md` — the
existing `AUTO` status, no new status word:

```
AUTO {time} — materiality-floor: {item} routed below floor ({defer-reason}) → digest. Reversibility: high (entry remains promotable or re-filable from the digest at any time).
```

This is bookkeeping, not decision-worthy — no Review Console row per entry.

## Expiry is not skipped work

An expired entry already passed the deferral gate (fix-now was attempted and refused for a stated
reason) and sat un-promoted for 90 days. Archival is a logged retention decision reachable only
through that gate — the distinction that separates it from the silent skipping CLAUDE.md's "No
implicit deferrals" rule forbids. `tidy/digest-sweep.md` performs this archival; see that file for
the exact promotion and expiry procedures.

## Consumers

These adopter files route below-floor findings here: `review/step3-routing.md`,
`wrap-up/residue-sweep.md`, `wrap-up/leftover-routing.md`, `reflect/full-mode.md`,
`reflect/hindsight-mode.md`, `visual-review/browser-review.md`, and the four health sweeps
(`code-health`, `docs-health`, `harness-health`, `journey-health`) — see `docs/skill-graph.md` for
the full per-skill relationship. `/tidy`'s digest sweep (`tidy/digest-sweep.md`) manages the
container's lifecycle (cluster promotion + expiry) independent of which adopters are actively
routing to it.
