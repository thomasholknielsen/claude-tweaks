# Impeccable's Direction Contract — locating and reading it

Impeccable writes a **direction contract** into the opening comment of the artifact it builds,
before the code. This file is the single procedure for finding that comment and reading it back.
It is cited by `/claude-tweaks:design-wrapper`'s `review` mode (which extracts the seed key and
records it) and by `/claude-tweaks:demo` (which renders the blocks to a human). Both cite it;
neither restates it.

## What this repo does and does not own

**Upstream owns the contract.** Its definition — the block names, the word budget, what each block
must say, and what makes a block inadequate — lives in the Impeccable plugin's own
`skills/impeccable/reference/new-work.md`, in the "Record the decision" step. Read it there.

This repo **never** defines, validates, reformats, or paraphrases it. Nothing here explains what a
block is supposed to contain, and nothing here judges whether a block is any good. Auditing the
render against the contract is `impeccable-finish-reviewer`'s job — upstream spawns it at the end of
its own build, and `/claude-tweaks:design-wrapper`'s `review` mode dispatches it again at code-review
time over the diff under review (`../design-wrapper/modes/review.md` Step 3.7). Either way the judging
is that agent's, never this procedure's.

What this repo does is narrower and purely structural:

1. find the comment,
2. recognize the five block labels well enough to split the text into blocks,
3. copy the seed key out of the `FORM` block as an opaque token,
4. hand both to a human at the acceptance gate.

The block labels are the only piece of upstream's contract this repo hard-codes, and they are
pinned by an assertion in `tools/upstream-drift/manifest.yml` so a rename upstream surfaces as
drift rather than as a silently empty brief.

## Step 1: Locate the comment

**Candidate files.** Whatever file list the calling skill already has — `review` mode's resolved
changed-UI-file list, `/demo`'s changed-path list from the closing commit or session recall. This
procedure never discovers files on its own.

**Bounded prefix.** Read at most the **first 4 KB** of each candidate. The contract is an *opening*
comment; a match past that boundary is some other comment and is not this. The bound also keeps a
large built artifact from being read whole just to check.

**Comment syntaxes.** Three are recognized, which is what Impeccable's own scannable extension set
(`.html .htm .css .scss .jsx .tsx .js .ts .vue .svelte .astro` — `SCANNABLE_EXT` in its
`scripts/context-signals.mjs`) can produce:

| Syntax | Opens / closes | Artifact families |
|---|---|---|
| `<!-- … -->` | HTML comment | `.html`, `.htm`, and the template half of `.vue` / `.svelte` / `.astro` |
| `/* … */` | block comment | `.css`, `.scss`, and the script half of every JS/TS family file |
| `//` | a run of consecutive line comments, treated as one block | `.js`, `.ts`, `.jsx`, `.tsx`, and script blocks |

**Anything else skips cleanly** — a `#`-commented file, a syntax not in this table, an unterminated
comment. Skipping is a defined outcome (Step 4, "no contract"), never a parse attempt on a syntax
this table does not name. Guessing at an unlisted syntax is how a half-read contract gets rendered,
and a half-rendered contract is worse than none because it looks complete.

**Which block.** Scan every comment block within the prefix, in order, and take the **first one that
carries the five labels** (Step 2). It is deliberately not "the first comment block" — a license
header, a generated-file banner, or a `<!doctype html>` preamble routinely sits ahead of it, and
requiring literal position would miss the contract in exactly the artifacts most likely to have one.

## Step 2: Recognize the blocks

Five labels, each a bare name immediately followed by `:` —

```
THESIS:   OWN-WORLD:   STORY:   FIRST VIEWPORT:   FORM:
```

Match case-insensitively, allowing any run of whitespace inside `FIRST VIEWPORT`. A block's body
runs from its own label to the start of the next label found, or to the end of the comment for the
last one. Order is not required: use the labels' actual positions, sorted, rather than assuming
upstream's ordering — presence is structural, ordering is not.

**All five must be present.** Four is malformed, not partial — see Step 4.

This is the whole of the recognition. Do not check a block's length, do not check the 150-word
budget, do not judge whether a block "reads like a mood." Those are upstream's criteria, applied by
upstream's own reviewer.

## Step 3: Extract the seed key

Look inside the **`FORM` block only** for a label matching `seed key`, `seed-key`, or `seed`
(case-insensitive) followed by `:`. Everything after that colon, up to the end of that line or the
end of the block — whichever comes first — is the seed value, **trimmed of surrounding whitespace
and copied verbatim**.

**The value is an opaque token.** Do not validate it, normalize case, strip punctuation, check a
length, or test it against a hex pattern. It only *defaults* to eight hex characters: the key is
freely user-supplied via `--from <key>` or `IMPECCABLE_CONCEPT_SEED`, so any shape is legal. Opaque
handling is also what makes a richer value survive — if the `FORM` block names a whole reproduction
recipe (`--scope direction --mode persuade --from a1b2c3d4 --reroll 1`) rather than a bare key, that
is copied through intact and is strictly more useful, because a re-roll round is part of what
reproduces a build and a bare key alone does not carry it.

**No label, no seed.** If the `FORM` block carries no such label, the seed is absent — Step 4's third
case. Do not go hunting for a bare token elsewhere in the block; a guess written into a record as
provenance is worse than a gap, because nothing downstream can tell the two apart.

## Step 4: The three outcomes

Every call to this procedure ends in exactly one of these. There is no fourth.

| Outcome | Condition | What the caller does |
|---|---|---|
| **No contract** | No candidate file has a qualifying comment in its prefix, or every candidate's syntax is unrecognized | Nothing. Render exactly as if this procedure did not exist — no empty section, no "not found" placeholder, no `Design-seed:` line. Most records will never have a contract, so this is the ordinary case and must be silent. |
| **Malformed** | A comment carries some but not all five labels, or a label with no body | Treat as **No contract** for every rendering and recording purpose, **and log it** (below). Never render the blocks that did parse. |
| **Contract, no seed** | Five labels present, `FORM` carries no seed label | Render the blocks. **Omit** the seed entirely — omit the `Design-seed:` line rather than writing it empty. This is normal, not drift: upstream's own wording carries the seed key *"when the seed dealt stagings,"* so a contract without one is a legal contract. |

**Logging the malformed case.** Inside a pipeline (`$PIPELINE_RUN_DIR` resolved), write one
`SCANNED` entry to `{run-dir}/decisions.md` per `auto-decision-log.md`, naming the file and which
labels were found. Outside a pipeline, say it in one line in the skill's own output. The point is
that a contract silently downgraded to "absent" leaves a trace — otherwise a renamed block upstream
looks identical to a record that simply never had a contract.

## Return shape

```json
{
  "found": true,
  "file": "src/routes/+page.svelte",
  "blocks": {
    "THESIS": "...", "OWN-WORLD": "...", "STORY": "...",
    "FIRST VIEWPORT": "...", "FORM": "..."
  },
  "seed": "a1b2c3d4"
}
```

`found: false` is the No-contract and Malformed outcomes both — `blocks` and `seed` are absent, and
`file` is absent too. `seed` is omitted (never `null`, never `""`) in the Contract-no-seed outcome,
so "the contract did not carry one" and "we wrote an empty one" can never be confused downstream.

## Consumers

| Skill | Uses |
|---|---|
| `/claude-tweaks:design-wrapper` `review` mode | Step 3.6 — runs this on the changed UI files it already resolved, then writes `seed` onto the work record as its `Design-seed:` body-metadata line |
| `/claude-tweaks:demo` | Step 2 — runs this on the changed-path list Step 1 already produced, and renders `blocks` under `### The design contract this was built against` |

`/demo` re-parses the shipped artifact rather than reading a copy captured at build time. That is
deliberate: the acceptance gate should show the contract that is actually in the file the human is
being asked to sign off on, and a cached copy could differ from it by the time anyone looks.
