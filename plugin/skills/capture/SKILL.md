description: Use when capturing ideas that need specification later — brain dumps, half-formed features, things to not forget

> **Interaction style:** Single decisions → one `AskUserQuestion` call, one option marked Recommended. Multi-item → batch table with recommendations pre-filled, then one `AskUserQuestion` for apply-all/override. Never more than one call per decision; resolve each before the next. Terminal `## Next Actions` → plain markdown: paste-ready fully-qualified commands, recommended first and bold, one per line — `AskUserQuestion` there only for a documented machine-consumed decision, named inline.


# Capture — Quickly note an idea for later specification

Quick capture for ideas that aren't ready for full specification. Part of the workflow lifecycle:

Lifecycle: `/claude-tweaks:init` → **`/claude-tweaks:capture`** → `/superpowers:brainstorming`

## When to Use

- User mentions something that should be a feature but isn't specified
- Discovery during implementation reveals something that needs its own spec
- "We should probably..." or "Don't forget to..." moments
- Anything that would otherwise be lost or forgotten

> **Backlog vs parked:** Use `/claude-tweaks:capture` for new ideas and half-formed features — these land as fresh backlog records: no stage label under `work-backend: github-issues`, no `stage:` frontmatter under `work-backend: local-files`. Work deferred from an active build/review goes through `/claude-tweaks:tidy`'s Defer action instead — the existing record gains the `parked` label (`github-issues`) or `stage: parked` frontmatter (`local-files`) plus a trigger. `/claude-tweaks:wrap-up`'s leftover routing is the other producer of `parked` records: it stages a *new* record for each unfinished spec section, which the Review Console creates on approval. Either way a deferred record carries origin context, file references, and a timing trigger that a fresh backlog record doesn't have. See `_shared/work-record.md` for the full stage vocabulary (backlog / parked / ready).

## Input

`$ARGUMENTS` is parsed as `<idea text> [--route=<value>] [--title="..."] [--type=<value>] [--needs-definition|--no-needs-definition] [--batch <path>]`:

| Argument | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Free-text idea | The body of the new backlog record (title is derived from the first phrase or supplied via `--title=`). Mutually exclusive with `--batch` — a batch invocation has no single idea text. |
| `--batch <path>` | Multi-entry filing — see Batch Mode below. `<path>` is a JSON file listing `{title, body, type?}` entries; each files through the same per-entry pipeline a single invocation runs, in one routing/confirmation pass for the whole set. Every other flag in this table applies uniformly across the batch unless an individual entry object supplies its own same-named field, which wins for that entry only. |
| `--route=brainstorm` / `--route=keep` / `--route=absorb:N` | Skip the post-capture routing prompt; apply the route directly. Legacy `--route` values are still accepted as aliases — see Immediate Routing. |
| `--title="..."` | Override the auto-derived title. |
| `--type=bug` / `--type=feature` / `--type=task` | Override the keyword-guessed Type outright — skips Guessing the Type below. Useful for auto-mode/headless capture calls (a Routine, or a scripted call from another skill's Next Action) where there is no next message to send a free-text correction in, and for any calling skill that already knows the correct type. |
| `--needs-definition` / `--no-needs-definition` | Override the content-judged Definition call outright — skips Judging Definition below. Same auto/headless rationale as `--type=`: forces the flag either way with no free-text turn to correct it. |
| `--defer-reason=<value>` | One of `DEFER_REASONS` (`bin/lib/issues/record.js`; vocabulary in `_shared/deferral-gate.md`). **Required** when the filing is a deferral — the body carries an `Origin:` line, `--origin=` was supplied, or any `--source` was given (a producer's Capture route); missing then → stop and report, file nothing. Optional otherwise. A `Defer-reason: {value}` line already inside the idea text counts as supplied (validated the same way). See the Shaped-body branch below. This includes health-skill triage captures passing `--source` — `tangential` is the usual fit. |
| `--risk=<low\|medium\|high>` / `--size=<low\|medium\|high>` | Shaped-body branch only: override the self-judged scoring — same auto/headless rationale as `--type=`. Ignored on the stub branch (a fresh capture is never scored). |
| `--origin="<text>"` | Shaped-body branch only: an `Origin:` provenance line for the composed body (producers' Capture routes pass their own). Its presence makes the filing a deferral (see `--defer-reason=`). |

When `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, prompt the user for the idea body.

## Workflow

| Step | What |
|------|------|
| 1 | Add the record — GitHub issue via `recordPayload`, or a `specs/{id}-{slug}.md` record via `local-store.js`, per Backend Selection below; a spec-shaped `$BODY` takes the Shaped-body branch (files scored + `ready`, skips the cap and the chain); under the born-ready condition, chains `/claude-tweaks:specify #{n} --chained` immediately after the record exists — see Backend Selection. |
| 2 | Route per `--route` arg, or via the Routing Prompt below. |
| 3 | Commit (when this is a standalone invocation; component-skill callers commit themselves). `work-backend: local-files` captures always have something to commit — the new record file, or, under route `absorb:N`, the edited/deleted target record file. `work-backend: github-issues` captures have nothing new to commit unless the failure fallback wrote a local `specs/{id}-{slug}.md` record — its `absorb:N` route edits the target issue via `gh` CLI only (see Route execution below), so no local file is touched. |

## Batch Mode

Reached only when `--batch <path>` is supplied — files multiple entries from one JSON file through the same per-entry pipeline Workflow Step 1 runs for a single invocation, with one routing/confirmation pass and one summary table for the whole set. Read `batch-mode.md` in this skill's directory for the full procedure: the entry-file shape, the per-entry loop and its fail-safe batching, over-cap entry handling, batch-level routing, and the Batch Summary template.

## Backend Selection

Read the `work-backend` field from the project's CLAUDE.md (under a `## Work records` section, written by `/claude-tweaks:init`). A missing flag is treated as `local-files` — same missing-flag convention as `design-integration`.

`$TITLE`/`$BODY`/`$TYPE` below are the same fields Entry Format and Adding an Entry (further down) have always asked for: `$BODY` is the `**Related:**`/`Context:`/`Scope:` block assembled per Entry Format; `$TYPE` is the guessed-then-confirmed Type from Adding an Entry.

Apply `by:capture`, the Type expression, and `needs:definition` (only when `$NEEDS_DEFINITION` is `true` — see Judging Definition below) and nothing else — that is the whole of this skill's permission-matrix row in `_shared/work-record.md`. Never stamp a scoring, `parked`, `auto:*`, or `bot:*` label on a fresh **stub** capture; a new record carries no stage label at all (the stage vocabulary is backlog / parked / ready, and `/claude-tweaks:tidy` and `/claude-tweaks:specify` are what move a record along it) — with two exceptions below: the ceiling-gated chained shaping, and the Shaped-body branch's scored, born-`ready` filing (its own section below).

**One exception, off by default.** Under `autonomy: trusted` or higher, and only when the
`producer:capture` class carries a `clean` trust verdict, a fresh capture is chained straight into
`/claude-tweaks:specify` shaping immediately after filing (`Skill(skill: "claude-tweaks:specify",
args: "#{n} --chained")` — headless, no Next Actions), so the record lands spec-shaped, scored,
and `ready` under specify's own authority — able to pass `/claude-tweaks:backlog refine` Step
3.5's spec-shape gate, which a bare `ready` stamp on a raw stub never could (#575). See
`_shared/autonomy-ceiling.md`. At `supervised`, the default and the state of any repo that has not
opted in, this never fires and the paragraph above holds unchanged. A filing that took the
Shaped-body branch (below) never chains either — there is nothing left to shape.

**Skip entirely when this filing carries `needs:definition`** (`$NEEDS_DEFINITION` is `true` —
see Judging Definition below). A record naming a genuine open choice cannot be born-ready by
construction: `ready` means agent-sized and unambiguous, and an undecided record is neither. Skip
before the `gh issue list`/git-log round-trip below, not just its conclusion — spending that
round-trip on a record that structurally cannot be born-ready is wasted work, not just a display
bug. File plain (no chain) and proceed straight to Backend Selection's filing step.

Resolve it as a **single decision, before filing**, and only under `work-backend: github-issues`
(the trust table reads `demo:*` labels, which do not exist on the `local-files` driver). Resolve
both policy values in ONE call — `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-policy.js" --values autonomy trust-revert-window-days`
(one value per line, in request order) — and substitute the first line's literal value for
`{resolved-ceiling}`. When it resolves to `supervised`, skip
this block entirely rather than fetching anything.

Substitute the second line's literal value (the resolved `trust-revert-window-days`) for
`{resolved-window}` below. If the `gh` call, the `git log`
call, or the node block fails for any reason, skip the chain — the record stays a plain capture:
this path fails toward the default, never toward the grant (unchanged from before this sub-issue). `{resolved-window}` reaches the
script as a `process.argv` arg after `--`, never spliced into the JS source — a value containing a
quote character would otherwise break out of the string literal, the same reason
`code-health/focus-mode.md`'s F1 block passes its own values that way.

Read through the session-scoped record snapshot (`_shared/record-queue-fetch.md`) instead of a
bare fetch — `comments` carries each record's own comment bodies (the negative-evidence marker
path, #268, reads `<!-- trust-negative-evidence: ... -->` back from here; the node block below
spreads `...i` so it reaches `trustRows` unchanged), and the snapshot's union field set already
carries it:

```bash
{Session-scoped record snapshot's read-fresh-or-fetch block, with {tmp-records-file} =
 /tmp/capture-trust-records.json}
```

Resolve the integration branch per `_shared/integration-branch.md`'s resolution ladder, substituting
its value for `{integration-branch}` below. The git-log dump follows the same session-scoped
freshness rule as the record snapshot (`_shared/record-queue-fetch.md`'s Session-scoped record
snapshot section) — reuse `/tmp/ct-gitlog-{session-id}.txt`
(`record-snapshot.js`'s `gitLogPath($CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID)`) when fresh, else regenerate it:

```bash
GITLOG=$(node -e "console.log(require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/record-snapshot.js').gitLogPath(process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID) || '')")
if [ -n "$GITLOG" ] && node -e "
  const { isFresh } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/record-snapshot.js');
  process.exit(isFresh(process.argv[1], Number(process.argv[2])) ? 0 : 1)
" "$GITLOG" "$(node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-policy.js" --values record-snapshot-ttl-seconds)"; then
  cp "$GITLOG" /tmp/capture-trust-git-log.txt
else
  git log "{integration-branch}" --format='%H%x1f%B%x1e' > /tmp/capture-trust-git-log.txt
  [ -n "$GITLOG" ] && cp /tmp/capture-trust-git-log.txt "$GITLOG"
fi
```

```bash
node -e "
  const fs = require('fs');
  const root = '${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}';
  const { trustRows, parseGitLog } = require(root + '/bin/lib/issues/trust.js');
  const { resolveCeiling, permittedGrants } = require(root + '/bin/lib/issues/autonomy.js');
  const issues = require('/tmp/capture-trust-records.json').map((i) => ({ ...i, labels: i.labels.map((l) => l.name) }));
  const gitLog = parseGitLog(fs.readFileSync('/tmp/capture-trust-git-log.txt', 'utf8'));
  const policy = { 'trust-revert-window-days': process.argv[1] };
  // This skill's own class. A fresh capture carries by:capture and no risk
  // score, and riskBand() bands an unscored record 'elevated' — so that is the
  // cell the record about to be filed will land in, and the only one that may
  // authorize it. Never read producer:capture|low here: it is a different class
  // with different evidence.
  const row = trustRows(issues, gitLog, Date.now(), policy).find((r) => r.key === 'producer:capture|elevated');
  const ceiling = resolveCeiling({ policy: '{resolved-ceiling}' });
  const permitted = permittedGrants({ ceiling, row });
  // Fallback to the flat keys: repo-HEAD skill text can run against an older
  // installed build's autonomy.js (no grants key yet). Remove with #647's
  // transitional twin (see bin/lib/issues/autonomy.js module header).
  const g = (permitted.grants || {}).bornReady || { granted: permitted.bornReady, reason: permitted.reason };
  console.log(JSON.stringify({ bornReady: g.granted, reason: g.reason, verdict: row ? row.verdict : 'no-cell' }));
" -- "{resolved-window}"
```

Never add `ready` to the label set below — a capture files plain at every ceiling. When
`bornReady` is `true`, complete the filing first, then invoke
`Skill(skill: "claude-tweaks:specify", args: "#{n} --chained")` in the same turn — shaping mode
composes the spec-shaped body around the stub (preserved as its `## Original request`), stamps
scoring and `ready` in its single compose-then-write-once call, and renders no interactive prompt
— and log one `decisions.md` line in `_shared/autonomy-ceiling.md`'s Logging shape (the
filed-then-shaped form). Never infer the answer from the policy value alone — the class verdict is
half the condition, and on a repo with no acceptance evidence `bornReady` is `false` at every
ceiling. If the `gh` call, the `git log` call, the node block, or the chained shaping itself fails
for any reason, the record simply stays a plain capture: this path fails toward the default, never
toward the grant.

**When `work-backend: github-issues`:**

1. Bootstrap per `_shared/label-bootstrap.md`, `LABELS_JSON`:

   ```bash
   # Bootstrap per _shared/label-bootstrap.md, LABELS_JSON =
   # [["by:capture", "Origin: filed via /capture"]]
   ```

   When the project's `work-types` key reads `labels`, also bootstrap the guessed `type:{t}` label the same way — its pair lives in `record.js`'s `TYPE_LABELS` (e.g. `['type:bug', 'Type: a defect in existing behavior']` when the guess is `bug`).

   When `$NEEDS_DEFINITION` is `true`, also bootstrap `needs:definition` the same way — its pair
   lives in `_shared/label-bootstrap.md`'s `LABELS_JSON` (`["needs:definition", "Undecided idea —
   must go through /specify's brainstorm redirect before reaching ready"]`).

2. Build the payload via `recordPayload` and create the issue. Both temp files below key off `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` (the same session identity `_shared/issue-claims.md` stamps on a claim) rather than a fixed name — a concurrent `/capture` invocation against the same checkout gets its own path, never this session's:

   ```bash
   node -e "const {recordPayload}=require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/record.js');
     const p=recordPayload({title:process.argv[1], body:process.argv[2], type:process.argv[3], origin:'capture'});
     require('fs').writeFileSync('/tmp/capture-' + (process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID||'') + '-payload.json', JSON.stringify(p))" "$TITLE" "$BODY" "$TYPE"

   node -e "console.log(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('/tmp/capture-' + (process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID||'') + '-payload.json','utf8')).body)" > "/tmp/capture-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID}-body.md"
   ```

   **Type expression branch.** Read the project's `work-types` config key once before filing and branch — never re-probe mid-flow (`_shared/work-record.md`'s config-key table; the key is written by `/init`). `work-types: native` applies `$TYPE` via GitHub's native Issue Type; `work-types: labels` adds the matching `type:$TYPE` label instead (the pairs live in `record.js`'s `TYPE_LABELS`):

   ```bash
   # work-types: native
   gh issue create \
     --title "$TITLE" \
     --body-file "/tmp/capture-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID}-body.md" \
     --type "$TYPE" \
     --label by:capture

   # work-types: labels
   gh issue create \
     --title "$TITLE" \
     --body-file "/tmp/capture-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID}-body.md" \
     --label by:capture \
     --label "type:$TYPE"
   ```

   Append `--label needs:definition` to whichever `gh issue create` call above ran, when
   `$NEEDS_DEFINITION` is `true`.

   Immediately after the `gh issue create` call succeeds, invalidate the session-scoped record
   snapshot (`_shared/record-queue-fetch.md`) — this filing changed what a `--state all` pull
   would return, so the next consumer must re-fetch rather than read the pre-filing snapshot — and
   remove this step's own temp files, now that `gh issue create` has read them:

   ```bash
   node -e "require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/record-snapshot.js').invalidateSnapshot(process.env.CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID)"
   rm -f "/tmp/capture-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID}-payload.json" "/tmp/capture-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID}-body.md"
   ```

3. **On failure** (GitHub unreachable, `gh` broken, transient API error): fall back to the local driver — write the record via `local-store.js`'s `createRecord` (atomic id allocation; see the local-files branch below for why `allocateId`+`writeRecord` is unsafe for creating a brand-new record). Same script as the local-files branch below, with one difference: `facets` also includes `unsynced: true`.

   Tell the user issue creation failed and the record landed locally instead (path printed by the script), `unsynced: true`. No further marker is needed beyond that facet — `/claude-tweaks:tidy`'s record scan surfaces `unsynced` local records as Sync findings, reconciling them onto GitHub on a later pass.

**When `work-backend: local-files` (or the flag is missing):**

Write the record via `local-store.js`'s `createRecord` — no `unsynced` facet (there is no GitHub side to reconcile against). This is the same script the `github-issues` branch's On-failure fallback above reuses, with `unsynced: true` added to `facets`. Use `createRecord`, not `allocateId`+`writeRecord`: two near-simultaneous `/capture` (or `/specify` decomposition) invocations calling `allocateId`+`writeRecord` separately can both read the same directory listing, both compute the same next id, and both succeed under different slugs — two records silently sharing one numeric id, corrupting any later `facets.parent`/`facets.blockedBy` reference that assumes id uniqueness. `createRecord` closes that race by allocating the id and writing the file as one atomic step (see `bin/lib/issues/local-store.js`'s header comments on `allocateId` and `createRecord`):

```bash
node -e "const fs=require('fs');
  const {createRecord, deriveSlug}=require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/local-store.js');
  const dir='specs';
  const existingSlugs=fs.existsSync(dir)
    ? fs.readdirSync(dir).map((n)=>/^\d+-(.+)\.md$/.exec(n)).filter(Boolean).map((m)=>m[1])
    : [];
  const slug=deriveSlug(process.argv[1], existingSlugs);
  const record = createRecord(dir, {
    slug,
    title: process.argv[1],
    body: process.argv[2],
    facets: { type: process.argv[3], origin: 'capture' }
  });
  console.log(record.path)" "$TITLE" "$BODY" "$TYPE"
```

Add `needsDefinition: true` to the `facets` object literal above, parallel to `type`/`origin`, when
`$NEEDS_DEFINITION` is `true` — the local-files mirror of the `github-issues` branch's
`--label needs:definition`.

`{slug}` is derived from the title by `local-store.js`'s `deriveSlug(title, existingSlugs)` — lowercase, collapse runs of non-alphanumeric characters to a single `-`, trim leading/trailing `-`, truncate to 60 characters, dedupe against `existingSlugs` with a numeric suffix (`-2`, `-3`, ...). One deterministic implementation, not a hand-executed algorithm — see `bin/lib/issues/local-store.js` and its tests in `tests/bin-lib/issues/local-store.test.js`. `createRecord('specs', { slug, ... })` allocates the numeric `{id}` prefix atomically as part of the same call — do not call `allocateId` separately when creating a brand-new record.

## Shaped-body branch

**Detection is by what is supplied, never by who invoked.** Split `$BODY` on line-anchored `## ` headings. The body is **shaped** when it contains `## Current State`, `## Deliverables`, and exactly one of `## Acceptance Criteria` / `## Open Question`, each followed by non-empty content, and none of the three placeholder markers `_shared/work-record.md`'s Spec-shaped body section names appears anywhere. Anything before the first heading becomes `header` (e.g. a `Trigger:` line the caller supplied) — EXCEPT an `Origin:` line and a `Defer-reason:` line, each lifted out of `header` into `provenance` (`origin` / `deferReason`) so the composer renders each exactly once; when both a body-carried `Origin:` line and `--origin=` are supplied, the body's line wins and the flag is ignored with a one-line note. A body that has the headings but fails the check falls through to the stub branch below with one line saying why. The deferral check below runs regardless of which branch is taken — it keys on content and `--source`, not on shape, so an unshaped `--source` filing without a valid reason also stops. A human who pastes a shaped body takes this branch too; a human typing a short idea still gets the stub and today's behavior.

On match, skip Entry Format's stub assembly and its character-budget cap, and run this precedence:

1. **Judging Definition first — and it wins.** `needs:definition` (judged, or `--needs-definition`, or an `## Open Question` section present) → compose via `specShapedBody` with `openQuestion`, `filedBy: 'capture'`, footer `_Filed by \`capture\` via specShapedBody._`, and file with `needs:definition`, no `ready`, no scoring (an undecided record is never born-ready). `--defer-reason=` is **not** required here — a needs-you record is not a deferral; when supplied it is still rendered via `provenance.deferReason`.
2. **The deferral check.** The filing is a deferral when the body carries an `Origin:` line, `--origin=` was supplied (both content signals — either way the composed body carries provenance), **or** any `--source` value was given — the rule keys on "any `--source`", not named producers. A deferral with no `--defer-reason=` and no `Defer-reason:` line in the text → **stop and report the missing reason; file nothing** (the same hard gate `wrap-up/refused-proposals.md` enforces at the console). This check is evaluated before branch selection — a supplied `--defer-reason=` is never silently dropped on the stub path (a stub deferral's validated value is passed to `recordPayload({deferReason})`, which inserts the body line). This is the one deliberate content-keyed exception where invoker identity enters (`--source` as the headless-caller equivalent of the `Origin:` content signal), named as such.
3. **Score and file born-ready.** Judge `risk`/`size` per `_shared/work-record.md`'s Scoring axis (or take `--risk=`/`--size=` overrides), compose via `specShapedBody({ header, currentState, deliverables, acceptanceCriteria, filedBy: 'capture', provenance: { origin: <the lifted line's value (the text after `Origin: `), else the `--origin=` text, else omitted>, deferReason }, footer: '_Filed by `capture` via specShapedBody._' })`, and file via Backend Selection's existing filing step with `recordPayload({ …, origin: 'capture', risk, size, ready: true, deferReason })` — `ready` regardless of the autonomy ceiling.

**Decision (recorded, not an omission):** `ready` on this branch follows from the born-ready rule's own reasoning — a `specShapedBody`-composed, scored body is structurally what health skills file, and they are `ready` by construction — not from a trust verdict; the human gate stays the grant at `refine`, and the trust ledger's `producer:capture` class grades outcomes post-hoc. Self-judged scoring is likewise deliberately unconditional (the same judgment `/specify` shaping mode makes).

**Skips on this branch:** the `gh issue list`/git-log trust fetch and #575's chain-into-`/claude-tweaks:specify` step never run — the record is already the shape that chain exists to produce. Presentation line: `Added: '{title}' (Type: {t}, Definition: clear, shaped — risk:{r} size:{s}, ready)`.

## Entry Format

Both drivers share the same body shape — this is `$BODY` in Backend Selection above:

```markdown
**Related:** {optional related record numbers, or "none"}

Context: 1-2 sentences on why this came up or what triggered it

Scope: Rough sense of what it might involve (can be vague)
```

**`work-backend: github-issues`** — this becomes the issue body; the issue title (`$TITLE`) is the short entry title.

**`work-backend: local-files`** — this becomes the record body under the frontmatter; `local-store.js`'s `writeRecord` composes the `# {title}` heading above it automatically.

### Hard cap: ~400 characters per entry

Measured over the `Context:` + `Scope:` field content combined (the prose after each label, not the labels themselves, not `**Related:**`) — a character budget, not a line count. Line count is gameable: a long paragraph wrapped or packed onto exactly 5 lines is not shorter than the same words spread across ten, and a naive line-count cap lets it through uncapped. Roughly 400 characters matches the two one-line "Good entries" examples below.

When the combined content exceeds the budget, it's past the raw-capture stage — branch on what kind of "past raw-capture" it is:

- **Genuinely undecided, half-formed thinking** (the common case) — run `/superpowers:brainstorming` on it instead.
- **Already-decided, evidence-carrying content** (an audit- or health-sweep-derived finding that already names a file/line and a determined fix, and would just be padded to fit the stub fields otherwise) — compose it as a spec-shaped body (`## Current State` / `## Deliverables` / `## Acceptance Criteria`) and pass that as `$BODY` instead of the stub fields. This takes the Shaped-body branch above, which has no length cap and files the record scored and `ready` — the sanctioned exception path, not a workaround of this cap.

Applies to both drivers. The cap governs the stub branch only — a supplied shaped body (see Shaped-body branch above) is exempt by design, which is also where the second case above lands.

## Adding an Entry

Both drivers run Backend Selection above; don't overthink — capture the essence.

When the idea proposes building a new `bin/` CLI, check for a same-named deliverable already
shipped or already proposed elsewhere before filing — `_shared/issue-claims.md`'s
Deliverable-name-collisions section owns the check and the grep.

### Guessing the Type

When `--type=<value>` is supplied, skip this entirely and use it as `$TYPE` — no guessing. Otherwise, Type is guessed from the idea's title/body text — advisory only:

| Title/body contains | Guessed Type |
|---|---|
| `fix`, `broken`, `crash`, `error`, `bug`, `regression`, `wrong`, `fails` | `bug` |
| `add`, `support`, `enable`, `new`, `allow`, `feature` | `feature` |
| none of the above | `task` |

The guess rides in the existing "Added: '{title}' (Type: {t})" presentation (see Immediate Routing below) — no new question is added. In interactive mode, the user can still override via free text in the next message even after a guess; `--type=` is the deterministic override for auto/headless invocation, where there is no next message.

### Judging Definition

When `--needs-definition` or `--no-needs-definition` is supplied, skip this entirely and use it
as `$NEEDS_DEFINITION` — no judgment, and the presentation line below renders with no rationale
clause (the human already decided). Otherwise, judge from the idea's content in this same turn:
does it name a genuine open choice with no tradeoff made yet — two or more viable directions,
no stated preference — or does it read as a single clear ask? This is a content call, not a
structural heuristic: resist scoring it by length or keyword match, the same way `solution:unjustified`'s
judgment is a content call rather than a mechanical check. `$NEEDS_DEFINITION` is `true` only when
the idea genuinely names an undecided choice; default `false` (clear) otherwise. When `true`, form
a one-line rationale naming the open choice — this becomes `$DEFINITION_RATIONALE`, surfaced in
the presentation line below and, later, bootstrapped/labeled per Backend Selection above.

The judgment rides in the same "Added: '{title}' (Type: {t}, Definition: {needed|clear})"
presentation the Type guess uses (see Immediate Routing below) — no new question is added.
When `$NEEDS_DEFINITION` is `true` and came from the judgment (not an override), append the
rationale inline: `(Type: {t}, Definition: needed — {$DEFINITION_RATIONALE})`. An override renders
without the rationale clause: `(Type: {t}, Definition: needed)` / `(Type: {t}, Definition: clear)`.

## Immediate Routing

After adding the record, route the item per the `--route` arg or by asking.

### Routing via `--route` arg (front-loaded)

`/claude-tweaks:capture` accepts `--route={brainstorm|keep|absorb:N}` to skip the post-capture prompt:

| `--route` value | Action |
|---|---|
| `brainstorm` | Open `/superpowers:brainstorming` with the new backlog record as input |
| `keep` | Record stays in backlog state — explicitly, no label asserts this; no further routing |
| `absorb:42` | Absorb the record into record `#42`; close the new record as not-planned |

Legacy route values `inbox` and `merge:N` are accepted as aliases for `keep` and `absorb:N`.

When `--route` is provided, log:
```
AUTO {time} — Routing: applied --route={value} for backlog record "{title}".
```
No further prompt. Proceed directly to the routed skill or commit.

### Routing prompt (when `--route` not provided)

In auto mode, apply the silences-table row for /capture from `_shared/auto-mode-contract.md`: if `--route` was passed, honor it; otherwise default to `keep` (the most conservative route — the record stays in backlog state for periodic review at `/tidy`, no further write that wouldn't have happened anyway). Log:
```
AUTO {time} — Routing: defaulted to keep (no --route provided). Reversibility: high (record stays in backlog state; user can re-route via /tidy at any time).
```

In interactive mode (or when explicitly opted in), present "Added: '{title}' (Type: {t}, Definition: {needed|clear})" (rationale clause per Judging Definition above, when applicable) and call `AskUserQuestion`:

- `question`: `"What should happen with this?"`, `header`: `"Route idea"`, `multiSelect`: `false`
- **High similarity** (two-criteria bar below, met by one candidate): absorb is **Option 1** — `label`: `"Absorb into record {N} (Recommended)"`, `description`: `"This belongs in an existing record"` — Brainstorm and Keep follow as Options 2-3. Several candidates meeting the bar: recommend the one sharing the most file paths, tie-broken by most-recently-updated (`updatedAt` from the widened fetch). Nothing merges silently — one click declines.
- **Low or ambiguous similarity** (a candidate exists, bar not met): today's ordering stands — Option 1 `label`: `"Brainstorm directly"`, `description`: `"Run /superpowers:brainstorming to explore the idea now, then /claude-tweaks:specify"`; Option 2 `label`: `"Keep as backlog record"`, `description`: `"Not ready yet, will be reviewed during /claude-tweaks:tidy"`; Option 3 (conditional) `label`: `"Absorb into record {N}"`, `description`: `"This belongs in an existing record"`.

The call has 3 options only when absorb is visible, in either ordering above; otherwise build it with Brainstorm and Keep only — never include an absorb option with a placeholder value.

> **Option 3 visibility:** Search for a candidate match on the topic keywords from the new backlog record, per the active driver from Backend Selection. `local-files` — search `specs/` for a record matching the keywords. `github-issues` — search open issues: `gh issue list --search "{keywords}" --state open --json number,title,labels,updatedAt --limit 5`, then for at most the top 2 candidates one `gh issue view {n} --json body` follow-up read before judging (the same search-narrow-then-fetch-full two-step `/specify`'s case 5 uses; the cap keeps the interactive path fast). Only show option 3 when either search returns a candidate. Without a candidate match, option 3 is omitted entirely — manual disambiguation against an unspecified record number is worse than no option at all.
>
> **High similarity** means both criteria hold, each anchored on a concrete shared artifact, not a similarity score: **(a) same file/subsystem** — the candidate's body (its `### Key Files` section when spec-shaped, else its title subject) and the capture's `Context:`/`Scope:` text name at least one identical file path or module/subsystem; **(b) same kind of change** — identical `type:{t}` value (the Type axis in `_shared/work-record.md`; `TYPE_LABELS` in `bin/lib/issues/record.js`) AND the same operation on that subject — matching verb-plus-target: both dedupe X, both fix the same failure, both extend the same surface.

### Route execution, by backend

| Route | `local-files` | `github-issues` |
|---|---|---|
| `brainstorm` | Opens the child skill with the record's text as input | Opens the child skill with the issue title + body as input (reference `#{issue-number}`) |
| `keep` | No further action — the record stays as-is at `specs/{id}-{slug}.md`, no `stage:` frontmatter | No further action — the issue is already open, `by:capture`-labeled, with no stage label. That **is** the backlog state; there is nothing to add. |
| `absorb:N` | Appends `## Absorbed: {YYYY-MM-DD} — {captured title}` under N's existing sections (never rewriting content above), delete the absorbed record's file | Per the Absorb mechanics below, then comment `Absorbed into #N.`, then `gh issue close {n} --reason "not planned"` |

**Absorb mechanics:** appends `## Absorbed: {YYYY-MM-DD} — {captured title}` under `#N`'s existing sections, never rewriting content above, composed once via `_shared/github-write-transport.md` (`gh issue edit {N} --body-file`); past 55,000 post-append chars (vs 65,536 cap), comment instead. Re-judges `size:` per `_shared/work-record.md` — raise only, never lower; `priority:*` stays unwritten, suggest higher priority in output. Names target + append; invalidates the session snapshot per `_shared/record-queue-fetch.md`.

**Unknown or invalid `N`** — when `--route=absorb:N` names a record that doesn't resolve (nonexistent, already closed/absorbed, or a number that doesn't exist under the active backend's numbering), stop before writing or closing anything and report the invalid `N` to the user instead of guessing a fallback route — the same rule `/claude-tweaks:tidy` applies to an unknown scope name. Do not silently fall back to `keep`.

This ensures every captured idea has an explicit next step — either immediate action or a conscious decision to keep it in backlog state.

**Good entries:**

- "Voice command to add item to shopping list" — context explains the need
- "Recipe nutrition facts display" — scope hints at UI + data needs

**Bad entries:**

- Just "nutrition" — too vague to act on later
- Full spec with 20 tasks — that's a spec, not a backlog record
- Notes about an existing spec ("spec 50 needs review") — put that on the spec itself

## Review Workflow

Periodically (or when the backlog gets long), use `/claude-tweaks:tidy` to batch-review all backlog records with recommended actions.

## Next Actions

When invoked by a parent skill, omit this block — the parent owns the handoff. When invoked directly by a user, render as plain markdown (docs/skill-authoring.md's Skill handoffs convention):

**`/claude-tweaks:capture {next idea}`** — capture another idea while you're in brainstorming flow (recommended)
`/claude-tweaks:tidy` — review and triage backlog records (promote, absorb, or drop stale items)
`/claude-tweaks:specify {ref}` — promote this record straight to a spec ({ref} is `#{n}` under `work-backend: github-issues`, or the record id under `work-backend: local-files`); omit this line when the born-ready chain already shaped the record earlier this turn — there is nothing left to promote

## Component-Skill Contract

This skill is a **component skill** — directly invoked by `/claude-tweaks:build` (Common Step 4, design-mode follow-up capture) and by `/claude-tweaks:reflect` (both `full` and `hindsight` modes' Capture disposition, routing an insight/finding that's too complex or uncertain to act on without brainstorming — a distinct path from reflect's Defer disposition, which files directly and is not a capture parent). `/claude-tweaks:visual-review`, `/claude-tweaks:wrap-up`, and `/claude-tweaks:demo` file a new backlog record directly without going through this skill, so they are NOT capture parents — they only recommend `/capture` in Next Actions for the user's next session.

Parent invocation of `/capture` is signaled by `$PIPELINE_RUN_DIR` being set in the environment. Direct invocation may pass `--source <parent-skill>` (e.g. `--source build`, `--source reflect`) as an explicit fallback when ambiguity exists (rare; `$PIPELINE_RUN_DIR` is the primary signal). This fallback matters here specifically: a standalone (non-`/flow`) design-mode `/build` invocation never resolves a run dir of its own (per `_shared/pipeline-run-dir.md`'s resolution order, the record-mode materialization exception and the standalone-auto allowlist both exclude design-mode `/build` — confirmed by `build/SKILL.md`'s own "Auto mode (including a standalone `auto` invocation with no pipeline run dir)" language). Standalone `/reflect` likewise has no run dir of its own to forward. When invoked from within a parent's workflow (via either signal), omit the `## Next Actions` block — the parent owns the handoff. When invoked directly by a user (neither signal present), render Next Actions as shown above.

**Side effect of `$PIPELINE_RUN_DIR`-based detection:** if a user invokes `/capture` directly while an active `/flow` pipeline is running, Next Actions are suppressed because the env var is set. This is intentional — pipeline-mid-flow handoff suggestions would conflict with the orchestrator's flow.

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Why It Fails |
|---------|-------------|
| Capturing an idea that already has a spec | Duplicates intent across two files — annotate the spec so it stays the source of truth |
| A *human brain-dump* growing past the character budget to dodge the cap | Half-formed thinking that needs length needs `/superpowers:brainstorming`, not a longer stub. A supplied spec-shaped body is different — that is the Shaped-body branch's intended input, filed born-ready |
| Never reviewing the backlog | Without periodic `/claude-tweaks:tidy` triage the backlog becomes a graveyard and ideas lose context |
| Adding implementation details to a backlog record | A record captures *what* and *why* — *how* is brainstorming + spec territory and shifts faster than the idea |
| Skipping `/superpowers:brainstorming` and jumping straight to specs | Specs encode unchallenged premises without the assumptions and constraints brainstorming surfaces |
| Putting notes about existing specs into a new backlog record | Notes drift from the spec they describe — annotate the spec file so the note moves with the work |
