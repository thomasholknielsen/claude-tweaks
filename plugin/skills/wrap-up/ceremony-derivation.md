# Diff-derived ceremony default (headless firings only, #1545)

Cited from `SKILL.md`'s Phase 1, right before the Reflect step reads `config.yml`'s
`ceremony-profile`. flow's Manifesto computes that value by folding every record's own
`ceremony:` header label (set at `/specify` shaping time) — before any code exists to inspect —
so a headless firing whose actual diff turns out small and low-surface still ran the full
`standard` ceremony if no record's label said `fast-lane`. Evidence: Dispatch hub run #9,
2026-08-26 — a +75/-2 test file plus its own materialized spec doc ran full-mode reflect, the
complete registry pass, and a residue sweep, ~8 of the firing's 43 minutes on ceremony nothing
acted on.

Skip entirely when `DISPATCH_HEADLESS=1` was not set on this run's invocation
(`dispatch/task-prompt.md`'s marker — a human-present firing already saw and could adjust the
Manifesto's `ceremony-profile` lever, so this derivation only ever applies where nobody was there
to catch a mismatch) or when no `config.yml` exists (standalone wrap-up). Otherwise, and only when
`config.yml`'s `ceremony-profile` currently reads `standard` — this lever's value is always
exactly the header-fold default in a headless (`auto`-mode, no Manifesto stop) firing, never a
human override (`flow/manifesto.md`'s Ceremony profile computation), so there is nothing here to
clobber:

1. Compute this run's diff facts via `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/dispatch/ceremony-derive.js"`'s
   `computeDiffFacts` over `git diff --numstat` against the run's own merge-base (the same facts
   shape `blast-radius-cli.js`'s `computeBlastRadius` already derives for the merge-check verdict —
   reuse `classifyDiffFiles`/`blastRadiusSummary`, don't re-derive).
2. When the diff touches zero production/implementation files — any mix of test and/or docs files
   only (`deriveCeremonyProfile`'s `lowSurface` classification; a test file plus a small amount of
   production code stays disqualified — a real behavioral change riding along with its own
   regression test must still default to `standard`) — downgrade **the ceremony requirement**, i.e.
   set `config.yml`'s `ceremony-profile` to `fast-lane` via the sanctioned writer:
   `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/set-config.js" --run "$PIPELINE_RUN_DIR" --key ceremony-profile --value fast-lane`.
3. Log: `AUTO {time} — Ceremony profile derived from diff: low-surface ({file-count} file(s), 0 production files) — header-fold default (standard) replaced with fast-lane.`

This never *upgrades* toward `standard` on its own — the diff-derived default only ever narrows a
`standard` default down to `fast-lane` for a diff this small; the Ceremony escape hatch (below
Reflect in `SKILL.md`) remains the only path back up to `standard`, and runs strictly after this
step, so a review/reflect safety finding on THIS run still overrides whatever this derivation just
set. A diff that is neither test-only nor docs-only leaves `config.yml` untouched — the
header-fold's `standard` default stands.
