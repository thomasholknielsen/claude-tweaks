# Tidy — Step 1: Audit Work Records

Step 1's full scan procedure, extracted from `scan-procedures.md` so the record scan is one
lazy-load unit instead of one section of an eleven-step file. That file keeps the
`## Step 1: Audit Work Records` heading as a stub pointing here, so an external reference naming
"`scan-procedures.md` Step 1" — or one of its shapes — still resolves in one hop.

The dispatcher reads this file **whole** and inlines it into the Work Records agent's prompt;
subagents cannot read sibling files, so everything that agent needs is either here or in the
`_shared/` fragments this file names for the dispatcher to inline alongside it.

Every other scan step (3, 4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5, 5.5) and the Collection routing table
stay in `scan-procedures.md`; every reference below to one of those steps means that file.

---

## Step 1: Audit Work Records

Read the `work-backend` field from the project's CLAUDE.md (under a `## Work records` section, written by `/claude-tweaks:init`). A missing flag is treated as `local-files`.

One query per driver feeds every finding shape below — the record store itself is the current landscape; there is no separate directory or index file to read (`_shared/work-record.md`). This single step replaces the old file-scan (former Step 1), spec-directory scan (former Step 2), and the backlog-issue portion of Step 4.8's `repo-wide` scan — all three read from the same record taxonomy now, so they collapse into one query + one facet parse.

Resolve this step's session-scoped temp paths once, per `_shared/session-tmp-root.md` (cited throughout this file rather than restated): `eval "$(node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/session-tmp-resolve.js" TIDY_RECORDS=tidy-records.json TIDY_RECORDS_FACETED=tidy-records-faceted.json TIDY_UNSYNCED=tidy-unsynced.json)"`. Fetch and facet-parse the queue per `_shared/record-queue-fetch.md` — the dispatcher inlines that file's `work-backend` resolution, both drivers' fetch commands (including the Session-scoped record snapshot section, so this fetch shares one `gh issue list --state all` pull per session with `/backlog`/`/capture`/`/specify`/`/help`/`/visualize` instead of paying for its own), and the Staleness clock and Threshold resolution sections into this agent's prompt (the same pattern already used for `_shared/github-pr-scan.md`), with `{tmp-records-file}` = `$TIDY_RECORDS`, `{tmp-faceted-file}` = `$TIDY_RECORDS_FACETED` — the legacy-taxonomy shape below (**Shape 5.5**) needs the raw `labels` array, not just the parsed `facets`, and the shared fetch's script already preserves both (its spread keeps `labels` alongside the derived `facets`).

Also pull any local fallback records left behind by a failed GitHub write — these feed the Sync shape below:

```bash
eval "$(node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/session-tmp-resolve.js" TIDY_UNSYNCED=tidy-unsynced.json)"
node -e "
  const { queryRecords } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/local-store.js');
  console.log(JSON.stringify(queryRecords('specs', { unsynced: true })));
" > "$TIDY_UNSYNCED"
```

Every record returned by the `local-files` driver's fetch already carries its parsed `.facets` — no separate parse pass needed. The shapes below are not all driver-universal, in both directions. Three never fire under this driver: no Sync finding (`facets.unsynced` is a github-issues-fallback-only concept — see `_shared/work-record.md`), no `bot:blocked`/`bot:parked` finding (the local driver "carries no bot state"), and no legacy-taxonomy finding (Shape 5.5 — its frontmatter schema never held the retired label vocabulary in the first place; that vocabulary is GitHub-label-only). Conversely, the two acceptance backstops — Shape 7 (parent gate due) and Shape 8 (closed record with no disposition) — fire **only** under this driver; their `github-issues` counterparts are Step 4.8's `parent-gate` and `acceptance-gap` scopes, which read GitHub issues. Both also run their own `queryRecords` pass rather than reading the fetch above, since both look at closed records and that fetch returns open ones.

**Staleness clock**, either driver: per `_shared/record-queue-fetch.md`'s Staleness clock and
Threshold resolution sections (`{REPO_ROOT}` resolves the same way Step 4.5 already
documents). Bands are computed by `classifyStaleness(ageMs, thresholdMs)`
(`bin/lib/issues/record-buckets.js`) against the resolved `record-staleness-weeks` threshold
(default 4 weeks): `fresh` below half the threshold, `review` from half the threshold up to
and including the threshold itself, `stale` beyond it. Shapes 1 and 2 below are the only
consumers of this scale — Step 3's design-doc age rows and Step 4.7's claim-staleness
rows read different data sources and are not governed by `record-staleness-weeks`.

The predicates referenced below (`isBacklog`, `isParked`, `isBotBlocked`, `isBotParked`) and `classifyStaleness`
come from `require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/record-buckets.js')`
(`bin/lib/issues/record-buckets.js`).

**Worklist rule (Shapes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8).** Per `_shared/work-record.md`'s worklist rule — a
headless unit skips any record another unit is already asking a human to decide — every
record-scoped shape below excludes a record carrying a `needs:*`-prefixed label from its own
findings, before applying that shape's own classification. `work-backend: github-issues`: exclude
any record whose raw `labels` array (preserved alongside `facets` by the shared fetch above)
contains a name matching `/^needs:/`. `work-backend: local-files`: exclude any record with
`facets.needsDefinition === true` — the only `needs:*` concept this driver structurally carries;
`needs:decision` is a `github-issues`-only label in this record's scope, with no local-files facet
to check. Shapes 5.5 and 6 are exempt — 5.5 never mutates anything (it only surfaces a rename
recommendation), and 6 is a stub pointing at Step 4.8. This is the first of the worklist rule's two
checks; the narrower same-unit dedup check (skip a record already carrying `/tidy`'s own unresolved
`needs-decision` comment for an identical proposal) is Phase 6's own scope, once `/tidy` writes
that marker — out of scope here.

### Shape 1 — backlog record stale

`isBacklog(record)` (`bin/lib/issues/record-buckets.js`) — no stage label (`github-issues`) or no `stage:` frontmatter (`local-files`); the default state, per `_shared/work-record.md`'s lifecycle spine. Classify by the staleness clock above:

| Age | Default Recommendation |
|-----|----------------------|
| Fresh | Keep |
| Review | Keep (unless clearly stale) |
| Stale | Delete or Promote |

**Decomposition parents are exempt — always `Keep`, at every age.** A record carrying `parent-issue` (`github-issues`) or `facets.isParentIssue === true` (`local-files`) is `isBacklog` by construction and forever: `/claude-tweaks:specify` never gives a parent a stage label and nothing ever promotes one, so every live parent crosses the staleness threshold and lands on `Delete or Promote` while its sub-issues are still being built — and `Delete` here is `gh issue close --reason "not planned"`, which destroys the decomposition's only acceptance checkpoint. Sub-issues landing weeks apart is the dominant workflow, so a parent going stale mid-decomposition is the common case, not the edge one. Give the row the reason inline (`Keep — decomposition parent, gated by the parent-gate sweep, not by staleness`) rather than dropping it silently, so a reader sees why one stale-looking record is being left alone. **Name the sweep the resolved driver actually uses** — Step 4.8's `parent-gate` scope under `github-issues`, **Shape 7 below** under `local-files` — since citing Step 4.8 on a project that never runs it points the reader at a sweep that will never produce the row it promises. Either way, that sweep is what acts on parents and this shape must not race it with a contradictory recommendation for the same record; under `local-files` they are not even separate agents — Shape 7 runs in this same Step 1 prompt, so a `Delete or Promote` row here would contradict a `[parent-gate]` row this same agent emits in the same reply.

**Digest containers are exempt too — always `Keep`, at every age.** An issue carrying `digest` is the materiality floor's rolling container (`_shared/materiality-floor.md`), not a work record: it never gets a stage label, so like a decomposition parent it is `isBacklog` by construction and forever, and a long-lived container inevitably crosses the staleness threshold — where `Delete` would close it out from under every entry it holds. Give the row the reason inline (`Keep — materiality-floor digest container, its lifecycle is Step 5.6's digest sweep, not staleness`). Only that sweep ever closes a digest issue (its 100-comment rollover), and it bootstraps the replacement in the same move — so this shape must not race it, exactly as it must not race the `parent-gate` sweep above.

→ Collect each as: `[backlog] {title} — {age} — {recommendation}`

### Shape 2 — parked trigger met

`isParked(record)` (`bin/lib/issues/record-buckets.js`). Judge the trigger live — the same evidence `_shared/github-pr-scan.md`'s `repo-wide` scope already reads, so this shape and that procedure never disagree:

| Trigger status | Default Recommendation |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Milestone attached, `milestoneDueOn` is in the past | Promote (re-run `/claude-tweaks:specify`) |
| A `**Watched paths:**` line in the body names a path with a matching commit since the record was parked (per `git log`), and that commit's own diff/message does not already resolve the record's described problem | Promote |
| A `**Watched paths:**` line in the body names a path with a matching commit since the record was parked (per `git log`), **and that commit's own diff/message already resolves the record's described problem** | Delete — already implemented (cite the resolving commit SHA in the closing comment) |
| Neither trigger met, not yet `Stale` (per the staleness clock above) | Keep |
| Neither trigger met, `Stale` (per the staleness clock above) | Re-evaluate or delete |
| Prose-only trigger, no clear date/path condition | Judge live each sweep — Keep, or move back to backlog state. When the trigger states a blocker as settled fact rather than naming an event to wait for, re-verify that fact directly against live evidence (grep the codebase/API/config for the asserted absence) — don't only search for an announcement that it was resolved |

A watched-path match is a signal to look again, not proof the record still needs work — read the matching commit's diff and message before recommending Promote. A commit that merely touches the watched path is not evidence the underlying problem is solved; only a commit whose content demonstrably addresses what the record describes counts as resolved. Conflating the two risks recommending `/claude-tweaks:specify` on a record whose work is already done, producing a redundant decomposition.

The prose-only row's live-evidence guard exists because a trigger can state its blocker as settled fact (e.g. #68: "Blocked today on an upstream capability that does not exist") — judging only whether that fact was ever announced resolved searches indefinitely for release notes that never arrive when the capability existed undocumented all along, or never existed as claimed. Re-verifying the blocker itself, not a report about it, closes that gap. The milestone row and the two watched-paths rows above are audited and confirmed immune to this same failure mode: a past-due `milestoneDueOn` and a matching commit since the record was parked are themselves the live evidence, not an announcement about it, so judging them live already checks the fact rather than a report of the fact — no separate guard is needed there.

→ Collect each as: `[parked] {title} — {recommendation}`

`local-files`: the same trigger lives as body prose — `local-store.js`'s facet schema carries no dedicated trigger/milestone/watched-paths keys, so a locally parked record's `**Trigger:**` (and, when file-shaped, `**Watched paths:**`) line is read straight out of the record body, judged exactly the same way.

### Shape 3 — unsynced local record

`work-backend: github-issues` only. Every record this step's session-scoped `$TIDY_UNSYNCED` returned (`facets.unsynced === true`) is a local fallback from a failed GitHub write — `/claude-tweaks:capture`'s or `/claude-tweaks:specify`'s failure path (`_shared/work-record.md`). This is F9 from the program promise register: it covers `specs/{id}-{slug}.md` records with `unsynced: true` facets, exactly the artifact `/capture` and `/specify` already promise `/tidy` reconciles.

→ Collect each as: `[unsynced] {title} — local-only, not yet mirrored to GitHub — Sync to GitHub`

### Shape 4 — ready record missing scoring

`facets.stage === 'ready'` and (`facets.risk === null` or `facets.size === null`). Labels are projection, not truth (`_shared/work-record.md`) — a `ready` record reaching this state without scoring usually means the label was hand-added on GitHub rather than stamped by `/claude-tweaks:specify`'s Shaping mode or a health skill's born-ready filing. `/claude-tweaks:backlog refine`'s own grant sub-stage would flag the identical gap reactively when it next pulls the `ready` queue; this surfaces it proactively during hygiene instead of waiting for a refine run.

→ Collect each as: `[scoring] {title} — missing {risk|size|both} — flag for scoring (/claude-tweaks:specify re-stamps it)`

### Shape 5 — `bot:blocked` needing re-triage

`isBotBlocked(record)` (`bin/lib/issues/record-buckets.js`; `work-backend: github-issues` only — the local driver's `facets.bot.blocked` is always `false`, per `facet-shape.js`'s shared defaults, so this predicate never fires there). The record hit its retry ceiling (`_shared/issue-claims.md`, `dispatch/SKILL.md`'s Settle step): grants revoked, and it needs a human's renewed judgment at `/claude-tweaks:backlog refine` before it can re-enter the autonomous queue.

→ Collect each as: `[blocked] {title} — hit its retry ceiling — re-authorize at /claude-tweaks:backlog refine`

### Shape 5.5 — record carries a retired taxonomy label

**`work-backend: github-issues` only** — the retired vocabulary below is GitHub-label-only, and a
local record's frontmatter schema never held it (the driver note above). Numbered 5.5 rather than
appended, so Shapes 6, 7, and 8 keep the numbers other files already cite.

Read the raw `labels` array the shared fetch preserves alongside `facets`, **not** the parsed
facets: a retired label is by definition one `parseRecordFacets` projects into the *renamed*
facet, so a facets-only read cannot tell which of the two label spellings produced it.

Retired labels — [IL-85] PERMANENT adopter-compat list; entries removable only at a major version dropping pre-rename repo support:

| Retired label | Current name | Renamed by |
|---|---|---|
| `family:parent` | `parent-issue` | #339 — see `_shared/work-record.md`'s Label taxonomy |
| `framing:baked` | `solution:unjustified` | #475 — see `_shared/work-record.md`'s Label taxonomy |

A record carrying an entry above is still **read** correctly everywhere: `_shared/github-pr-scan-acceptance.md`'s
`parent-gate` and `acceptance-gap` scopes fetch both spellings for `family:parent`/`parent-issue`,
and `record.js`/`local-store.js` keep the matching legacy-label/frontmatter fallback for every row
in this table. This shape does not fix a broken read — it surfaces the rename as a one-command
hygiene action, so an adopter repo eventually stops needing the compatibility path at all. The
recommended command is the current-name rename for whichever retired label was found on this
record — `{retired}`/`{current}` below are that row's own two columns, not a literal.

→ Collect each as: `[legacy] {title} — carries retired label {retired} — recommend: gh label edit "{retired}" --name "{current}"`

Severity `info`, and **no mutation** — the row is surfaced for visibility and the rename stays the
user's call, since `gh label edit` re-labels every issue carrying it repo-wide in a single
outward-facing API write. It is therefore not one of the Action
Vocabulary's atomic actions (`SKILL.md`), and routes as an always-surfaced no-op at every
aggressiveness tier (`step-6-auto.md`'s **Legacy taxonomy** row), exactly like Shapes 4 and 5.

### Shape 5.6 — `bot:parked` needing re-triage

`isBotParked(record)` (`bin/lib/issues/record-buckets.js`; `work-backend: github-issues` only — the local driver's `facets.bot.parked` is always `false`, per `facet-shape.js`'s shared defaults, so this predicate never fires there). `_shared/pr-first-merge.md`'s Step 2.5 (Merge-verification gate) parked the record on a red or timed-out check on its PR — this park does **not** revoke any grant (a red/timed-out CI check is not a build failure), so the record still carries its `auto:*` grants and needs no re-authorization, only a human checking the PR's checks before it can resume. Numbered 5.6 rather than appended, so Shapes 6, 7, and 8 keep the numbers other files already cite.

→ Collect each as: `[bot-parked] {title} — parked by merge-verification — check the PR's checks, resume via /claude-tweaks:dispatch`

### Shape 6 — flagged code demonstrably gone

Not scanned here. This is Step 4.8's code-health/harness-health/journey-health/docs-health issue judgment (`_shared/github-pr-scan.md`'s `repo-wide` scope, items 3/5/6/7) — unchanged by this merge. It's listed in this file only so the finding shapes the record-scan design replaces (former Steps 1 and 2, plus former Step 4.8's backlog-issue item) stay documented in one place; the mechanics that actually judge "is the flagged code gone" continue to live where they already did.

### Shape 7 — decomposition parent gate due

**`work-backend: local-files` only.** Finds decomposition parents whose every sub-issue has closed
but which carry no acceptance disposition yet — the population
`/claude-tweaks:wrap-up`'s Parent-Gate Procedure (`wrap-up/verification-brief.md`) gates eagerly
when it closes a parent's last sub-issue. A parent whose last sub-issue closes any other way — by
hand, or by a run that ended before wrap-up — never reaches that eager path; this shape catches it
after.

Both backstop shapes below (this one and Shape 8) filter out below-floor candidates the same way
their `github-issues` counterparts do — the same `bin/lib/issues/oversight-floor.js` predicate
(#366), mirrored here rather than reimplemented. Each shape resolves `risk-floor`/`size-floor`
**once, inside its own code block** (one `resolve-policy.js` call regardless of population size,
never resolved per record) and passes the printed values as literal `process.argv` arguments to
that same block's script — never resolved in a separate block and carried over via a shell
variable, since shell state does not survive between separate Bash calls (the same discipline
`_shared/github-pr-scan-acceptance.md`'s fetch-limit/work-links resolutions state for their own
identical case). A closed record below the floor never needed a disposition in the first place, so
it is not a gap.

It is the local twin of Step 4.8's `parent-gate` scope (`_shared/github-pr-scan-acceptance.md`) — same
finding, same `[parent-gate]` prefix, same `Open parent gate` action; only the store differs. It
lives in this step rather than that file because that file is skipped whole whenever `gh` is
absent, and a sweep needing no `gh` must not inherit that skip; that scope's own header states
the full reasoning, including what `_shared/forge-detection.md`'s Detection Ladder (which that scope runs behind) does and does not gate on.

Classification is entirely `parentGateState`'s (`bin/lib/issues/acceptance.js`) — do not
reimplement it. That predicate is backend-agnostic: it takes `{subIssues, parentLabels}` (the shipped
signature's own key names), and a local parent's disposition translates to the one-element
`['demo:' + facets.acceptance]` (empty when unset), exactly as
`wrap-up/verification-brief.md`'s **Evaluate the gate** does for this driver.

It needs its own query, not Step 1's shared fetch: that fetch returns open records only and
carries no sub-issue-to-parent index, and a parent's sub-issues are closed by definition when its
gate is due.

A parent's aggregate risk is the **max** `risk:*` tier across its sub-issue records — never a size
read at the parent level (a local parent carries no scoring of its own, same as its `github-issues`
counterpart), and the predicate call below passes the literal `sizeFloor: null`, never the resolved
`$SIZE_FLOOR` value: passing the real value here, with no `size` facet to read, would fail every
parent closed on a missing size it was never meant to have. Any single unscored sub-issue (missing
or out-of-vocabulary `risk`) makes the whole parent's aggregate unscored too, matching
`exceedsOversightFloor`'s own fail-closed rule:

```bash
RISK_FLOOR=$(node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-policy.js" --values risk-floor)
node -e "
  const { queryRecords } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/local-store.js');
  const { parentGateState } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/acceptance.js');
  const { exceedsOversightFloor } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/oversight-floor.js');
  const { TIERS } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/record.js');
  const [riskFloor] = process.argv.slice(1);
  const parents = queryRecords('specs', { isParentIssue: true });
  const gates = parents.map((p) => {
    const subIssueRecords = [
      ...queryRecords('specs', { parent: p.id }),
      ...queryRecords('specs', { parent: p.id, closed: true }),
    ];
    return {
      id: p.id,
      title: p.title,
      path: p.path,
      needsDefinition: p.facets.needsDefinition === true,
      parentLabels: p.facets.acceptance ? ['demo:' + p.facets.acceptance] : [],
      subIssues: subIssueRecords.map((r) => ({ number: r.id, state: r.facets.closed ? 'CLOSED' : 'OPEN', risk: r.facets.risk })),
    };
  });
  function maxRiskTier(subIssues) {
    let hasUnscored = false;
    let maxIndex = -1;
    for (const subIssue of subIssues) {
      const index = TIERS.indexOf(subIssue.risk);
      if (index === -1) { hasUnscored = true; continue; }
      if (index > maxIndex) maxIndex = index;
    }
    return hasUnscored ? undefined : TIERS[maxIndex];
  }
  gates
    .filter((f) => !f.needsDefinition)
    .filter((f) => exceedsOversightFloor({ risk: maxRiskTier(f.subIssues) }, { riskFloor, sizeFloor: null }).exceeds)
    .filter((f) => parentGateState({ subIssues: f.subIssues, parentLabels: f.parentLabels }) === 'due')
    .forEach((f) => console.log(f.path + '\t[parent-gate] ' + f.id + ': ' + f.title + ' — parent complete, no acceptance disposition — Open parent gate, then /claude-tweaks:demo ' + f.id));
" "$RISK_FLOOR"
```

Each line is `{path}<TAB>{finding}` — the path fills the row's `Path:Line` column (`SKILL.md`'s
Tidy-specific column semantics: the local record path on this driver, where `github-issues` rows
carry `#{n}`), the rest is the finding.

Both `queryRecords` shapes are deliberate. `{ isParentIssue: true }` returns **open** parents only
(closed records are excluded unless the filter names `closed`) — the right set, since a closed
parent was already dispositioned and closed by `/claude-tweaks:demo`, and it mirrors the
`github-issues` scope's `--state open` fetch. The sub-issue listing is the open+closed two-call
merge for the same reason: one call alone drops every closed sub-issue, exactly the ones that make
a gate due. No fetch-limit or truncation warning applies, unlike the API-paging twin —
`queryRecords` reads the whole `specs/` directory every call.

→ Collect each as: `[parent-gate] {id}: {title} — parent complete, no acceptance disposition — Open parent gate, then /claude-tweaks:demo {id}`

Severity `info` — with several open decompositions this is a standing backlog, not a defect
count, and Step 6 caps rows highest-severity-first (the same tier and reason as its
`github-issues` twin). The recommendation is the `Open parent gate` action, staged at every
aggressiveness tier and never writing `demo:approved`/`demo:changes-requested`, which is why the
row still ends with `/claude-tweaks:demo {id}`; `actions-local-files.md`'s `## Open parent gate`
and `step-6-auto.md`'s row carry that action's execution, its staging reasoning, and what it
does not cover.

### Shape 8 — closed record with no acceptance disposition

**`work-backend: local-files` only.** Finds records that closed carrying no acceptance
disposition at all — work that shipped and disappeared with nothing on record about whether it
actually solved the problem. Its `github-issues` counterpart is Step 4.8's `acceptance-gap` scope
(`_shared/github-pr-scan-acceptance.md`), and this shape exists for the same reason Shape 7 does: that scope
queries GitHub labels, and its whole file is skipped whenever `gh` is unreachable — its Detection
Ladder gates on remote/install/auth, never on the driver — so a sweep that needs no `gh` must not
inherit that skip. Same `[acceptance-gap]` prefix, same recommendation, same severity, so no
consumer distinguishes the two; only the store differs.

This is the backstop, not the eager path. `/claude-tweaks:wrap-up` applies a disposition as it
closes a record it owns (`wrap-up/verification-brief.md`); a record closed any other way — by
hand, by a `closed: true` frontmatter edit, by a run that ended before wrap-up — never reaches
that path, and with no sweep here would stay invisible permanently.

Classification is entirely `needsBackstop`'s (`bin/lib/issues/acceptance.js`) — do not reimplement
the disposition taxonomy. That predicate is backend-agnostic: it reads `{state, labels,
hasParent}`, and a local record translates as `facets.closed === true` → `state: 'CLOSED'`,
`facets.acceptance` → the one-element `['demo:' + facets.acceptance]` and empty when unset (the
identical translation Shape 7 and `wrap-up/verification-brief.md`'s `local-files` paths already
use), and `facets.parent !== null` → `hasParent`.

**Excluding decomposed sub-issues is load-bearing, not a refinement.** `needsBackstop` returns
`false` for anything passed `hasParent: true`, because a sub-issue's acceptance lives on its parent
issue — Shape 7's population — and never on the sub-issue. Drop that translation and every
sub-issue of every closed decomposition lands here as a row, flooding the report with exactly the
records another shape already covers. That is the same reason the `github-issues` scope resolves
its own sub-issue set before filtering.

It needs its own query, not Step 1's shared fetch: that fetch returns open records only, and every
record this shape looks at is closed by definition. `risk-floor`/`size-floor` are resolved again
here, independently of Shape 7's own resolution above — per the discipline stated at the top of
Shape 7, shell state does not survive between separate Bash calls, so a value resolved there is
empty here:

```bash
{ read -r RISK_FLOOR; read -r SIZE_FLOOR; } < <(node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resolve-policy.js" --values risk-floor size-floor)
node -e "
  const { queryRecords } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/local-store.js');
  const { needsBackstop } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/acceptance.js');
  const { exceedsOversightFloor } = require('${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/lib/issues/oversight-floor.js');
  const [riskFloor, sizeFloor] = process.argv.slice(1);
  const cutoff = Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
  queryRecords('specs', { closed: true })
    .filter((r) => r.facets.needsDefinition !== true)
    .filter((r) => {
      const closedAt = Date.parse(r.facets.closedAt);
      return Number.isNaN(closedAt) || closedAt >= cutoff;
    })
    .filter((r) => exceedsOversightFloor({ risk: r.facets.risk, size: r.facets.size }, { riskFloor, sizeFloor }).exceeds)
    .filter((r) => needsBackstop({
      state: r.facets.closed ? 'CLOSED' : 'OPEN',
      labels: r.facets.acceptance ? ['demo:' + r.facets.acceptance] : [],
      hasParent: r.facets.parent !== null,
    }))
    .forEach((r) => console.log(r.path + '\t[acceptance-gap] ' + r.id + ': ' + r.title + ' — closed with no acceptance disposition — recommend /claude-tweaks:demo ' + r.id));
" "$RISK_FLOOR" "$SIZE_FLOOR"
```

Each line is `{path}<TAB>{finding}`, the same shape Shape 7 emits — the path fills the row's
`Path:Line` column (`SKILL.md`'s Tidy-specific column semantics: the local record path on this
driver, where `github-issues` rows carry `#{n}`), the rest is the finding.

`{ closed: true }` is required, not decorative. `queryRecords` mirrors `gh issue list --state
open` and drops every closed record unless the filter names `closed`
(`bin/lib/issues/local-store.js`), so the bare `queryRecords('specs', {})` this step's shared
fetch uses returns exactly zero of this shape's population — silently, with no error to say so.
No fetch-limit or truncation warning applies, unlike the API-paging twin: `queryRecords` reads the
whole `specs/` directory every call.

The 30-day window nominally matches the `github-issues` scope's own closed-record set. It reads
`closed-at:`, which `closeRecord` stamps — **and deliberately keeps every record whose `closedAt`
is absent or unparseable**, regardless of age. A record closed by a hand-edited `closed: true`
with no timestamp is precisely the un-dispositioned, nobody-remembers-it case this backstop exists
for, so the bound fails open, toward surfacing; filtering on a missing timestamp would drop the
shape's best population. **`#205`: this makes "same population" true only for the timestamped
majority** — `gh issue list` always stamps a real `closedAt` on a closed issue, so the
`github-issues` twin has no equivalent fail-open case and its 30-day cutoff is strict. A
hand-closed local record with no timestamp can surface here at any age; its `github-issues`
counterpart cannot. The population this shape actually catches skews toward exactly that
untimestamped set — `closeRecord`-closed records (the common path) always get a timestamp and so
are excluded past 30 days like the other driver.

→ Collect each as: `[acceptance-gap] {id}: {title} — closed with no acceptance disposition — recommend /claude-tweaks:demo {id}`

Severity `info` — the same tier and the same reason as its `github-issues` twin: on a project that
closes records ad hoc this is a standing backlog rather than a defect count, and Step 6 caps rows
highest-severity-first, so any tier above `info` would permanently evict actionable rows beneath
it. Unlike Shape 7, the recommendation is **not** one of the Action Vocabulary's atomic actions —
this shape mutates nothing at all, on either driver. It recommends `/claude-tweaks:demo {id}` and
stops there, because disposing a closed record is a human judgment about whether shipped work
solved the problem. It is staged at every aggressiveness tier for that reason (`step-6-auto.md`'s
Acceptance-gap row, which covers both drivers), the auto-mode contract keeping that judgment off
what `auto` silences.
